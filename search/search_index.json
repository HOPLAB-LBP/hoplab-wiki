As it is managed by Sona Systems, it is often referred to with this name as well. It can be accessed through this link. Here is some general info about the system:</p> <ul> <li>The EMS can be used to schedule the experiment, set time slots, and easily manage the availability of participants. It can also facilitate communication between researchers and participants, such as sending reminders for scheduled experiments or sharing important information. The system provides a clear overview of available experiments, the status of participation, and accredited course credits.</li> <li>All first-year psychology students can participate in experimental research by signing up through the EMS as part of their research methods course (typically between mid October and the end of May and in July). </li> <li>A credit system is used in which they can earn course credits (18 research participation points) by participating in collective (max. 12 points) and/or individual testing sessions. </li> <li>Students can also opt to do an alternative assignment to earn 2 course credits (i.e., writing a 1-2 page description of the participant experience from the methods section of a recent empirical paper). In this way, students can earn the same course credits as they would for participating in an experiment. This option is provided to ensure voluntariness of participation at all times. </li> <li>In addition, both students and non-students can sign up through the EMS for paid studies throughout the entire year.</li> </ul> <p>PPW-affiliated researchers (you!) can offer their (on-site as well as online) experiments on the platform through a researcher account: </p> <ul> <li>To request such an account, send an email to ioco@kuleuven.be, and provide the following information: [firstname], [lastname], [u-number]@kuleuven.be, [firstname].[lastname]@kuleuven.be). </li> <li>Master's thesis students supervised by PPW staff are also allowed to access the participant pool, but supervisors need to request an account on their behalf. </li> <li>Participants can create an account themselves by following the instructions on the website of the EMS.</li> </ul> <p>If you or your participants have any questions or problems related to the EMS, please check out these Youtube tutorials (for participants, for researchers) and/or rely on peer support (fellow students/researchers) before addressing the system administrator at ioco@kuleuven.be.  </p> <p>Recruitment Bias</p> <p>It is important to consider potential recruitment biases when using the EMS. Since the pool primarily draws from university students, particularly first-year psychology students, the sample may not be fully representative of the general population. Additionally, there is often a higher proportion of female students in our faculty, which can introduce gender bias into the research findings.

Assign resources (RAM, disk, cpus) reasonably (&lt; 80% of your system capacity).   - install fmriprep-docker. this is as easy as <code>pip install fmriprep-docker</code>.   - share with docker the folders you are going to use. these are you BIDS folder, and a <code>temp_fmriprep</code> folder.   - run fmripre-docker. Below you can see my terminal call to pre-process sub-41. The arguments I use (and a lot more that I don't use) are explained here. Make sure you are familiar with these.</p> <pre><code>fmriprep-docker /data/projects/chess/data/BIDS /data/projects/chess/data/BIDS/derivatives/fmriprep participant --work-dir //data/projects/chess/data/temp_fmriprep --mem-mb 10000 --n-cpus 16 --output-spaces MNI152NLin2009cAsym:res-2 anat fsnative --fs-license-file /data/projects/chess/misc/.license --bold2t1w-dof 9 --task exp --dummy-scans 0 --fs-subjects-dir /data/projects/chess/data/BIDS/derivatives/fastsurfer --notrack --participant-label 41\n</code></pre> <p>Note</p> <p>if you want to run analysis on surface data, you may want to consider getting CIFTI output images from fmriprep. I did not test this, but it should produce cortical BOLD series projected from the Glasser2016 template (the same parcellation I use for MVPA). In theory, SPM should be able to analyze .gii surface data, and bt getting the CIFTI outputs you should already have the parcellation projected to subject space for subsequent analyses. Or at least it should give a Glasser parcellation on subject/MNI space that is directly usable for MVPA, therefore skipping the quite time-sonsuming and complicate step to produce the HPC ROIs (see below)</p> <p>Warning</p> <p>this call is very resource and time intensive. It will take several hours (4-8, depending on your PC specs) at full capacity to preprocess a single subject. If you need to process many subjects, you may want to play with the ncpus and mem-mb parameters to be sure that you are using all the available resources. A good test of this is to open the task manager on windows, and check the CPU and RAM usage during a run. Ideally, we want the CPU to be always at max speed, and the RAM to be 10 GB below the maximum. If the RAM needed by the process is higher than the RAM available, you will get Out of Memory errors, or No more space on disk errors if you did not specify a work-dir folder. If this happens, lower the mem-mb and n-cpus until tyou find the right spot.</p> <p>If the run finishes successfully (check the last line of your terminal output), you should have a new <code>BIDS/derivatives/fmriprep/sub-xx</code> folder (see here for a complete list of outputs generated by fmriprep). make sure that inside you <code>anat</code> and <code>func</code> folders you have all the scans (anatomical, functional all runs) in the spaces you specified.

Running the GLM and setting the contrasts is as easy as running script03. Remember to double-check the parameters at the top of the file. Specifically, you will need to adjust:   - read/write folder, including the fmriprep folder in <code>fmriprepRoot</code>, your BIDS folder in <code>BIDSRoot</code>, the folder you want to save your GLM results to (it should ideally be in the derivatives folder, in a <code>fmriprep-spm</code> folder) in <code>outRoot</code>, and a directory to store your temporary files (e.g., uncompressed, since SPM can't read compressed gz files, and/or smoothed files) in <code>tempDir</code>.   - the list of subjects you want to analyze in <code>selectedSubjectsList</code>. It must be list of integers like <code>selectedSubjectsList = [41,42,43,44];</code> or <code>selectedSubjectsList = '*';</code> to perform the analysis on all subjects.   - the list of runs you want to analyze in <code>selectedRuns</code>.   - The contrasts you want to set to get the corresponding t-maps.

You can check whether the subject folder contains a sub-folder for each analyses task, along with <code>beta_000x.nii</code> files for each regressor (i.e., each confound and condition * number of runs).</p> <p>At this stage, it is strongly advisable to check whether the design matrix was correctly specified. To do so, you can open the SPM GUI by typing <code>spm fmri</code> in your Matlab Command Window, then click on 'Results' and select the SPM.mat file inside your bets images directory in <code>BIDS/fmriprep-spm/{space}/sub-xx/{task_name}/</code>. This will open the SPM Contrast Manager, that will show the design matrix and assigned contrasts. Make sure the matrix looks reasonable (no overlapping or extremely long conditions, correct number of runs, confound regressors at the end of each run, etc.), and that the contrast weights were assigned correctly. </p> <p>Now, select your contrast and click 'Done'. In the next window, select apply masking -&gt; None, p value adjustment -&gt; None -&gt; 0.001, threshold -&gt; 0. And voila'! You will see the results of the contrast -- that is, your thresholded t map for this subject -- on the top right, along with a list of significantly active cluster on the bottom right panel.</p> <p>If you want, you can visualize these activations on a volume of your subject (or on the surface if you have performed recon-all). To do so you can click on 'Display' -&gt; 'overlays...' and select 'sections' if you want to plot on the volume, or <code>render</code> if you want to plot on surface. This will open a new windows, where you need to select the subject anatomical image. This image will be in the <code>BIDS/derivatives/fmriprep/sub-xx/anat</code> folder. If you plot on sections, you need to select the nii file corresponding to the same space your GLM was performed on (usually MNI). If you plot on surface, select the pial or inflated brain.</p> <p>Warning</p> <p>As I mentioned above, SPM cannot import nii.gz files directly, so you will need to decompress the anatomical image into a .nii. This can be done very easily with any decompressing tool by right-clicking the file in your file explorer.

If you use an anatomical mask, make sure it is in the same space as your subjects, and it has the same resolution.
