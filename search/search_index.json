I did not test this, but it should produce cortical BOLD series projected from the Glasser2016 template (the same parcellation I use for MVPA). In theory, SPM should be able to analyze .gii surface data, and bt getting the CIFTI outputs you should already have the parcellation projected to subject space for subsequent analyses. Or at least it should give a Glasser parcellation on subject/MNI space that is directly usable for MVPA, therefore skipping the quite time-sonsuming and complicate step to produce the HPC ROIs (see below)</p> <p>Warning</p> <p>this call is very resource and time intensive. It will take several hours (4-8, depending on your PC specs) at full capacity to preprocess a single subject. If you need to process many subjects, you may want to play with the ncpus and mem-mb parameters to be sure that you are using all the available resources. A good test of this is to open the task manager on windows, and check the CPU and RAM usage during a run. Ideally, we want the CPU to be always at max speed, and the RAM to be 10 GB below the maximum. If the RAM needed by the process is higher than the RAM available, you will get Out of Memory errors, or No more space on disk errors if you did not specify a work-dir folder. If this happens, lower the mem-mb and n-cpus until tyou find the right spot.</p> <p>If the run finishes successfully (check the last line of your terminal output), you should have a new <code>BIDS/derivatives/fmriprep/sub-xx</code> folder (see here for a complete list of outputs generated by fmriprep). make sure that inside you <code>anat</code> and <code>func</code> folders you have all the scans (anatomical, functional all runs) in the spaces you specified.

Specifically, you will need to adjust:   - read/write folder, including the fmriprep folder in <code>fmriprepRoot</code>, your BIDS folder in <code>BIDSRoot</code>, the folder you want to save your GLM results to (it should ideally be in the derivatives folder, in a <code>fmriprep-spm</code> folder) in <code>outRoot</code>, and a directory to store your temporary files (e.g., uncompressed, since SPM can't read compressed gz files, and/or smoothed files) in <code>tempDir</code>.   - the list of subjects you want to analyze in <code>selectedSubjectsList</code>. It must be list of integers like <code>selectedSubjectsList = [41,42,43,44];</code> or <code>selectedSubjectsList = '*';</code> to perform the analysis on all subjects.   - the list of runs you want to analyze in <code>selectedRuns</code>.   - The contrasts you want to set to get the corresponding t-maps.

You can check whether the subject folder contains a sub-folder for each analyses task, along with <code>beta_000x.nii</code> files for each regressor (i.e., each confound and condition * number of runs).</p> <p>At this stage, it is strongly advisable to check whether the design matrix was correctly specified. To do so, you can open the SPM GUI by typing <code>spm fmri</code> in your Matlab Command Window, then click on 'Results' and select the SPM.mat file inside your bets images directory in <code>BIDS/fmriprep-spm/{space}/sub-xx/{task_name}/</code>. This will open the SPM Contrast Manager, that will show the design matrix and assigned contrasts. Make sure the matrix looks reasonable (no overlapping or extremely long conditions, correct number of runs, confound regressors at the end of each run, etc.), and that the contrast weights were assigned correctly. </p> <p>Now, select your contrast and click 'Done'. In the next window, select apply masking -&gt; None, p value adjustment -&gt; None -&gt; 0.001, threshold -&gt; 0. And voila'! You will see the results of the contrast -- that is, your thresholded t map for this subject -- on the top right, along with a list of significantly active cluster on the bottom right panel.</p> <p>If you want, you can visualize these activations on a volume of your subject (or on the surface if you have performed recon-all). To do so you can click on 'Display' -&gt; 'overlays...' and select 'sections' if you want to plot on the volume, or <code>render</code> if you want to plot on surface. This will open a new windows, where you need to select the subject anatomical image. This image will be in the <code>BIDS/derivatives/fmriprep/sub-xx/anat</code> folder. If you plot on sections, you need to select the nii file corresponding to the same space your GLM was performed on (usually MNI). If you plot on surface, select the pial or inflated brain.</p> <p>Warning</p> <p>As I mentioned above, SPM cannot import nii.gz files directly, so you will need to decompress the anatomical image into a .nii.
