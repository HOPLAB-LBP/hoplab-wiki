This is the landing page for this section. Please populate it with appropriate information.

[Here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/15XpN0bbqh1pz8g5nwIjFsnmhPi1jtMcX?usp=sharing) there is a very simple and work-in-progress notebook I made to understand who to position the camera, mirror, etc. Ideally, we need get the reflecte beam as close and perpendicular as possible to the eye.

**TODO:** populate this landing page.
