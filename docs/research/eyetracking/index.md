# Eye-tracking

For setting up the long-range eye-tracking system in the fMRI room (MR8), please consult [this](../fmri/fmri-procedure.md#eyetracker-setup) page.

If you want more information on the stand-alone eye-tracking system to run behavioural experiments, please consult [this](PLACEHOLDER) page instead.

**NOTE**: I am not sure whether we need this eye-tracking section. We could perhaps just keep the ET info within the relevant sections (fmri, behaviour)? Unless there is more general info that does not fit in those sections, e.g. lin to scripts, resources, manuals, overall workflow to collect, process and analyze data (which I would assume is roughly the same between fmri and behaviour).
