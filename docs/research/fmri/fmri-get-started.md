## Before you start

Before diving into your (f)MRI study, make sure you're prepared by following the steps below.

### Get formal ethical approval

Note that for most fMRI studies (including healthy adult participants), ethical approval has already been obtained and will fall under application nr. S62131 (until end of December 2025) or S70813 (from January 2026 onwards, hopefully). 

Follow the yellow section of the [flowchart](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/6hdu5z594ojaxh2/AAATYJes74w8KvI0OEOd1MmYa?e=4&preview=Flowchart_MR8_scanning.pdf) to make sure everything is in order for you to start scanning.

1. **Register your study at the CTC**:
   After this you receive an S-number (for more info, we refer you to [this page](../ethics/MEC.md#step-1-register-your-study-at-the-uz-leuven-clinical-trial-center-ctc)).
2. **Register your study at the MR research department**:
   Upload the [application form for support from the Radiology department](https://gbiomed.kuleuven.be/english/ctc/supporting-hospital-departments-for-public-ctc-website/aanvraagformulier_radiologie_eng) via [this link](https://www.uzleuven.be/en/uploading-application-forms-supporting-departments-ctc). Include the Clinical Study Coordinator of Radiology (currently, that is <lesley.cockmartin@uzleuven.be>) as contact person, who will approve your request via email.
3. **Get approval from the ethical committee of UZ/KU Leuven**:
   For more info, we refer you to [this page](../ethics/MEC.md#step-2-apply-for-ec-approval).
4. **Follow the MR safety course**:
   And become an authorized user of the MRI-scanner (see below).


### Attend the MR safety course

- **Course dates**:  
   This course is organized twice a year by Dr. Ron(ald) Peeters, the MR Safety Officer. The exact course dates will be announced via the MR mailing list, and are typically in February and September.
- **Preparation**:  
   Before attending, carefully read the `Safety notes, rules & procedures` document in the MRI dropbox folder, which you can find [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/6hdu5z594ojaxh2/AABZQbnhdwjvfqvxcW6YztQda?e=1&preview=Safety+Rules++Procedures+Research+MRI+UZL-KUL+v3.2.pdf).

2. **Card activation for MR suite access**:   
  After you have completed all the steps above, Ron will arrange everything and you will automatically gain access to MR8 with your KU Leuven staff/student card.
    
### Training and preparation

Before you can become an Authorized Other User (AOU), you must undergo practical training and testing:

1. **Observational training**:  
  After reviewing all relevant documentation, observe scan procedures by joining sessions of your colleagues. We have an internal slack channel to keep track of upcoming scans, so make sure you are invited to it if you want to be up to date.

2. **Testing protocols**:  
   Before your pilot (f)MRI session with an actual participant, set up your sequences and test your experiment script. Book a phantom session by contacting Dr. Ron(ald) Peeters at [ronald.peeters@uzleuven.be](mailto:ronald.peeters@uzleuven.be). If needed, you can find specific info on the projector screen [here](https://kuleuven.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/T0005824-Hoplab/Shared%20Documents/Hoplab/Research/MRI/Info%20for%20newbies/Planning%20a%20scan%20session/MR8_screeninfo.docx?d=w68475dcf8e6f4182b4e682e343b22356&csf=1&web=1&e=qkMSkk).

!!! warning "Independent scanning"
    You are allowed to conduct scans independently after attending approximately **10 sessions** with experienced personnel (e.g., more senior colleagues). This will help you learn how to control the scanner effectively. After 2 sessions, you should know how to control the scanner and you are allowed to be the second researcher during a scan session outside office hours.

## During your experiment

Understand and follow the detailed MR scan procedures to ensure efficient and safe usage of the MRI facilities.

### Scanner procedures

All referenced documents are regularly updated and available in the [Hoplab Teams folder](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3A9fcb4eb9c75049d4bad118cf8afcb9cb%40thread.tacv2/Hoplab?groupId=714187e1-4ec7-496a-9922-933eb237402f&tenantId=3973589b-9e40-4eb5-800e-b0b6383d1621&ngc=true). **Ensure you read the latest versions** before proceeding.

- **Booking the scanner**:  
  Once you completed all steps above, you can start use the scanner. Note that there are different booking procedures depending on whether you are running a pilot or an experiment. For a pilot, email Ron(ald) Peeters (ronald.peeters@uzleuven.be) to book the pilot session (a new subject profile must be created manually, using some random ID number). For an experimental session, book the scanner via the [MRI scientific planning agenda](https://www.kuleuven.be/radiology/Research/Agenda/researchAgendas.html). Details on how to do this can be found in the [instructions for use](https://www.kuleuven.be/radiology/Research/Agenda/importantInformation.html) on the planner webiste, the [`MRI Planning Agenda`](https://kuleuven.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/T0005824-Hoplab/Shared%20Documents/Hoplab/Research/MRI/Info%20for%20newbies/Planning%20a%20scan%20session/MRI%20Planning%20Agenda.docx?d=wc7edb06d379b4a04b16cfe3fcb0002c0&csf=1&web=1&e=sEPgnG) located in the Hoplab Teams folder and in [`Safety notes, rules & procedures`](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/6hdu5z594ojaxh2/AAATYJes74w8KvI0OEOd1MmYa?e=5&preview=Safety+Rules++Procedures+Research+MRI+UZL-KUL+v3.2.pdf) (pages 8-11) located in the MRI dropbox folder. Note that some periods are booked for users from our faculty. Time slots named _Reserved for core user psychology_ on the calendar are for any researcher from our faculty to use.

- **Using the Scanner**:  
  Operational guidelines for the MR scanner are outlined in the [`fMRI protocol_MR8_October2019`](https://kuleuven.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/T0005824-Hoplab/Shared%20Documents/Hoplab/Research/MRI/Info%20for%20newbies/What%20to%20do%20at%20the%20scanner/fMRI%20protocol_MR8_October2019.docx?d=wa122d4476efc4dd4b1b0e43bc892bb7e&csf=1&web=1&e=eZmJ0U) document, available in the Hoplab Teams folder. There, you can also find a useful [checklist](https://kuleuven.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/T0005824-Hoplab/Shared%20Documents/Hoplab/Research/MRI/Info%20for%20newbies/Planning%20a%20scan%20session/ChecklistMR8.docx?d=w195af25d58334931bee6a959e882c312&csf=1&web=1&e=fP4qHE) that you can use as a reminder during scanning. For detailed information on what to do before, during and after a scan, please refer to the ]Scanning procedure](fmri-scanning-procedure.md) page.

### Managing scan data and invoicing

- **Tracking sessions**:  
  Keep detailed records of all scan sessions, noting which sessions provided useful data and/or when you experienced technical issues. Regular reports should be made to your Principal Investigator (PI). In case of technical issues, it is useful to also include what kind of issues you had as well as an estimation of the amount of time lost due to the issues.

- **Quarterly reports**:  
  Every four months, your PI will receive an Excel sheet listing all scan sessions conducted during that period. This file will be forwarded to all researchers who have scanned in the corresponding period.

- **Documenting experiments**:  
  Complete the Excel sheet with the experiment name for each session and clearly note down comments for any session that did not yield useful data for various reasons (e.g., participant cancellation, no-shows, artifacts, technical issues) and send it back.

- **Financial management**:  
  Support staff (currently Klara) will further process the file by including the name of the SAP antenna (i.e., An Van Kets), specifying the funding source for each researcher, and by adjusting the total invoice amount on the invoice to reflect the actual scan hours based on successful data collection sessions ("corrected total").
