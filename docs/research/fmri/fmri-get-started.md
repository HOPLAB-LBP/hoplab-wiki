# fMRI for Newbies @KUL

## Get started

Kickstart your fMRI learning journey by engaging in the following key activities:

=== "Subscribe to the MR Mailing List"
    - **How to Subscribe**:  
      Join the MR mailing list by visiting [this link](http://listserv.cc.kuleuven.ac.be/archives/mri.html). Click on "join list" and provide your full email address (e.g., `firstname.lastname@uz.kuleuven.ac.be`) along with your first and last name.  
      - **Purpose of the List**:  
        This mailing list allows participants to ask questions about MRI practices and share information on MRI equipment status and upcoming MR safety courses.

=== "Browse Documentation"
    - **Access Documentation**:  
      Documentation related to fMRI studies is available on our shared Drive. This includes manuals, protocols, and safety procedures.  

=== "Participate in a Study"
    - **Get Involved**:  
      If you're interested in participating in an fMRI study, start by filling out the questionnaire available at [fMRI Experiment Questionnaire](http://ppw.kuleuven.be/home/english/research/lbp/questionnaires/lbp-fmri-experiment-questionnaire).  
      - **Study Details**:  
        Participation involves being a subject in fMRI scans, which helps gather valuable data for research. This can also provide insight into how fMRI studies are conducted.

Regular updates and additional resources are added to our shared Drive. Stay informed by regularly checking the documentation and updates on the MR mailing list.
  
- **TODO**: Fix the links to the documentation and add more resources such as flowcharts and external information. Check the Gdrive for updates.

## Before You Start

Before diving into your fMRI study, make sure you're prepared by following these steps:

### Read the Necessary Documentation

1. **Manuals**:  
   Carefully read the `fMRI protocol_MR8_xxxxx` and `Safety notes, rules & procedures`. Access these documents here (https://www.dropbox.com/sh/6hdu5z594ojaxh2/31SaPxJ7B0).

2. **Flowchart**:  
   Follow the provided flowchart step-by-step to understand the complete process. [View Flowchart](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/6hdu5z594ojaxh2/31SaPxJ7B0)

### MR Safety Course

- **MR Safety Course**:  
   Attend the MR Safety Course organized by Dr. Ron Peeters, the MR Safety Officer. 

The next course date will be announced via the MR mailing list, typically in February and September. Before attending, review the **Safety Rules and Procedures Document** available in the MR Dropbox.

### Ethical Approval

- **Dutch Documents**:  
   Available via the LBP_fMRI drive (`General Information\Ethiek\All Ethical Applications`). 

- **Language Requirements**:  
   Some documents can be completed in English; however, all submissions must be made in English. Further details can be found in the document `GeneralInfoMEC_EN.docx`.

### Gaining Access to MR Facilities

After obtaining ethical approval:

- **Document Submission**:  
   Send the completed `MR_Access.xlsx` and the approved Informed Consent to [ilse.roebben@uzleuven.be](mailto:ilse.roebben@uzleuven.be) and [silvia.kovacs@uzleuven.be](mailto:silvia.kovacs@uzleuven.be).

- **Safety Checklist**:  
   Complete the `MRI_Safety_Checklist_xxxx.pdf` and sign `Appendix1A_v1.2.pdf`. [Access Forms](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/6hdu5z594ojaxh2/31SaPxJ7B0).

Send both files to [ronald.peeters@uzleuven.be](mailto:ronald.peeters@uzleuven.be) along with your details (name, U-number, e-mail address) and the S-numbers of your study.

??? info "Card Activation for MR Suite Access"
    Depending on your current card type:
    
    - **Old KU Leuven Card (dark blue)**: Visit the "Dienst Toegangsbeheer" at UZ Gasthuisberg between 8.00 and 16.00 on weekdays for activation.
    - **New KU Leuven Card (light blue)**: Obtain a new card from the same location. A deposit is required, refundable upon card return.
    
    Follow the purple arrows to the elevators at level 1 and then to the "technische dienst: toegangsbeheer" at level -1 for this service. Ron will email activation details, and your card will be functional after 24 hours.
    
- **TODO**: the information above may be not accurate anymore. Make sure it is correct.

### Training and Preparation

1. **Observational Training**:  
  After reviewing the documentation, observe scan procedures by joining sessions of your colleagues. Use the shared calendar to track and request to join upcoming sessions [here](http://teamup.com/ksd9dc6bd657d2b8bb/).

2. **Testing Protocols**:  
   Before your pilot fMRI session with an actual subject, set up your sequences and test your experiment script. Book a phantom session by contacting Dr. Ronald Peeters at [ronald.peeters@uzleuven.be](mailto:ronald.peeters@uzleuven.be).
   
!!! warning "Independent Scanning" 
    You are allowed to conduct scans independently after attending approximately **ten sessions** with experienced personnel. This will help you learn how to control the scanner effectively.

## During your experiment

Understand and follow the detailed MR scan procedures to ensure efficient and safe usage of the MRI facilities.

### Scanner procedures

- **Booking the Scanner**:  
  Details on how to book the MR scanner can be found in the `fMRI Planning Agenda.docx` and `Safety Rules Procedures Research MRI UZL-KUL v3.0.pdf` (pages 8-10) located in the LBP_fMRI drive and Dropbox respectively.

- **Using the Scanner**:  
  Operational guidelines for the MR scanner are outlined in the `fMRI protocol_MR8_April2015.docx`, available on the LBP_fMRI drive.

All referenced documents are regularly updated and available on the LBP_fMRI drive. **Ensure you have the latest version** before proceeding.

### Managing Scan Data and Invoicing

- **Tracking Sessions**:  
  Keep detailed records of all scan sessions, noting which provided useful data. Regular reports should be made to your Principal Investigator (PI).

- **Quarterly Reports**:  
  Every three months, your PI will receive an Excel sheet listing all scan sessions conducted during that period.

- **Documenting Experiments**:  
  Complete the Excel sheet with the experiment name for each session and note down any sessions that did not yield useful data due to various reasons.

- **Financial Management**:  
  Include the name of your Research Support and Financial officer under the total invoice amount. Additionally, adjust the total on the invoice to reflect the actual scan hours and amount due based on successful data collection sessions.

!!! tip "Invoicing Details"
    Add columns in your invoicing reports to specify the funding source for each session, and mark any sessions that should not be charged due to issues like cancellations or technical problems.
