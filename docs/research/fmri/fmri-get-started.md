### Attend the MR safety course

- **Course dates**:  
   This course is organized twice a year by Dr. Ron(ald) Peeters, the MR Safety Officer. The exact course dates will be announced via the MR mailing list, and are typically in February and September.
- **Preparation**:  
   Before attending, carefully read the `Safety notes, rules & procedures` document in the MRI dropbox folder, which you can find [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/6hdu5z594ojaxh2/AABZQbnhdwjvfqvxcW6YztQda?e=1&preview=Safety+Rules++Procedures+Research+MRI+UZL-KUL+v3.2.pdf). In the dropbox folder, you can also find the slides used in a previous safety course ([2020 version](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/6hdu5z594ojaxh2/AABZQbnhdwjvfqvxcW6YztQda?e=1&preview=MRI_safety_leuven_2020_21_09.pdf)). Additionally, in our Hoplab Teams folder, you can find some [additional safety information](https://kuleuven.sharepoint.com/:b:/r/sites/T0005824-Hoplab/Shared%20Documents/Hoplab/Research/MRI/Scanner%20info%20%26%20safety/Additional%20safety%20information.pdf?csf=1&web=1&e=2gYT4M).

### Gain access to MR facilities

- **Document submission**:  
   After obtaining ethical approval, send the completed [MR Access file](https://www.dropbox.com/s/hh0l3swkjnx96vb/MR_Access.xlsx?e=1&dl=0) and the approved ICF to [ilse.roebben@uzleuven.be](mailto:ilse.roebben@uzleuven.be) and [silvia.kovacs@uzleuven.be](mailto:silvia.kovacs@uzleuven.be).

- **Safety checklist**:  
   Before entering the Controlled Area for the first time, complete the [MRI Safety Checklist](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/6hdu5z594ojaxh2/AABZQbnhdwjvfqvxcW6YztQda?e=1&preview=MR+patient+Questionnaire+-+ENGELS.pdf) and sign [this Appendix](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/6hdu5z594ojaxh2/AABZQbnhdwjvfqvxcW6YztQda?e=1&preview=Appendix1A_v1.2.pdf) that states you followed the MR safety course, read the necessary documentation and pledge to follow the local rules of operation. Send both files to [ronald.peeters@uzleuven.be](mailto:ronald.peeters@uzleuven.be) along with your details (name, U-number, e-mail address) and the S-number of your study.

??? info "Card activation for MR suite access"
    Depending on your current card type:

    - **Old KU Leuven Card (dark blue, "Katholieke Universiteit Leuven")**: Visit the technical services department "Toegangsbeheer" at UZ Leuven (green street, poort 5, level -1) between 8.00 and 16.15 on weekdays for activation of your card.
    - **New KU Leuven Card (light blue, "KU Leuven")**: Obtain a new card at the same location to get access. A deposit is required, refundable upon card return.
    
    Ron should have emailed toegangsbeheer (toegangsbeheer@uzleuven.be) with his permission to activate your card. If everything works out, your card will be functional after 24 hours.
    
**TODO**: the information above may be not accurate anymore. Laura S should probably update this section, since she is the last doing this?

### Training and preparation

Before you can become an Authorized Other User (AOU), you must undergo practical training and testing:

1. **Observational training**:  
  After reviewing all relevant documentation, observe scan procedures by joining sessions of your colleagues. We have an internal slack channel to keep track of upcoming scans, so make sure you are invited to it if you want to be up to date.

2. **Testing protocols**:  
   Before your pilot (f)MRI session with an actual participant, set up your sequences and test your experiment script. Book a phantom session by contacting Dr. Ron(ald) Peeters at [ronald.peeters@uzleuven.be](mailto:ronald.peeters@uzleuven.be). If needed, you can find specific info on the projector screen [here](https://kuleuven.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/T0005824-Hoplab/Shared%20Documents/Hoplab/Research/MRI/Info%20for%20newbies/Planning%20a%20scan%20session/MR8_screeninfo.docx?d=w68475dcf8e6f4182b4e682e343b22356&csf=1&web=1&e=qkMSkk).

!!! warning "Independent scanning"
    You are allowed to conduct scans independently after attending approximately **10 sessions** with experienced personnel (e.g., more senior colleagues). This will help you learn how to control the scanner effectively. After 2 sessions, you should know how to controle the scanner and you are allowed to be the second researcher during a scan session outside office hours.

## During your experiment

Understand and follow the detailed MR scan procedures to ensure efficient and safe usage of the MRI facilities.

### Scanner procedures

All referenced documents are regularly updated and available in the [Hoplab Teams folder](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3A9fcb4eb9c75049d4bad118cf8afcb9cb%40thread.tacv2/Hoplab?groupId=714187e1-4ec7-496a-9922-933eb237402f&tenantId=3973589b-9e40-4eb5-800e-b0b6383d1621&ngc=true). **Ensure you read the latest versions** before proceeding.

- **Booking the scanner**:  
  Once you completed all steps above, you can book the scanner via the [MRI scientific planning agenda](https://www.kuleuven.be/radiology/Research/Agenda/researchAgendas.html). Details on how to do this can be found in the [instructions for use](https://www.kuleuven.be/radiology/Research/Agenda/importantInformation.html) on the planner webiste, the [`MRI Planning Agenda`](https://kuleuven.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/T0005824-Hoplab/Shared%20Documents/Hoplab/Research/MRI/Info%20for%20newbies/Planning%20a%20scan%20session/MRI%20Planning%20Agenda.docx?d=wc7edb06d379b4a04b16cfe3fcb0002c0&csf=1&web=1&e=sEPgnG) located in the Hoplab Teams folder and in [`Safety notes, rules & procedures`](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/6hdu5z594ojaxh2/AAATYJes74w8KvI0OEOd1MmYa?e=5&preview=Safety+Rules++Procedures+Research+MRI+UZL-KUL+v3.2.pdf) (pages 8-11) located in the MRI dropbox folder.

- **Using the Scanner**:  
  Operational guidelines for the MR scanner are outlined in the [`fMRI protocol_MR8_October2019`](https://kuleuven.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/T0005824-Hoplab/Shared%20Documents/Hoplab/Research/MRI/Info%20for%20newbies/What%20to%20do%20at%20the%20scanner/fMRI%20protocol_MR8_October2019.docx?d=wa122d4476efc4dd4b1b0e43bc892bb7e&csf=1&web=1&e=eZmJ0U) document, available in the Hoplab Teams folder. There, you can also find a useful [checklist](https://kuleuven.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/T0005824-Hoplab/Shared%20Documents/Hoplab/Research/MRI/Info%20for%20newbies/Planning%20a%20scan%20session/ChecklistMR8.docx?d=w195af25d58334931bee6a959e882c312&csf=1&web=1&e=fP4qHE) that you can use as a reminder during scanning. **NOTE**: refer to the page with hospital information once all the info from the fMRI_protocol_MR8_October2019 file has been moved

### Managing scan data and invoicing

- **Tracking sessions**:  
  Keep detailed records of all scan sessions, noting which sessions provided useful data. Regular reports should be made to your Principal Investigator (PI).

- **Quarterly reports**:  
  Every three months, your PI will receive an Excel sheet listing all scan sessions conducted during that period.

- **Documenting experiments**:  
  Complete the Excel sheet with the experiment name for each session and note down comments for any session that did not yield useful for various reasons (e.g., participant cancellation, no-shows, artifacts, technical issues).

- **Financial management**:  
  Include the name of your SAP antenne (i.e., An Van Kets) below the total invoice amount. Additionally, adjust the total on the invoice to reflect the actual scan hours and amount due based on successful data collection sessions ("corrected total").

!!! tip "Invoicing details"
    Add columns in your invoicing reports to specify the funding source for each session, and mark any sessions that should not be charged due to issues like cancellations or technical problems.
