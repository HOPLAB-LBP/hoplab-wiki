# Practical scanning protocol

This page describes the procedures followed by our lab (LBP) to scan at MR8, including information specific to the hospital, bookings, rooms, contacting people, parking tickets, etc. Some general remarks:

- MR8 is a Philips Ingenia scanner ([consult the manual](https://kuleuven.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/T0005824-Hoplab/Shared%20Documents/Hoplab/Research/MRI/Scanner%20info%20%26%20safety/Manual_Philips-MR8?csf=1&web=1&e=1Bh0eI)) with a 32-channel head coil located at MR suite E408 ([map and directions](https://kuleuven.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/T0005824-Hoplab/Shared%20Documents/Hoplab/Research/MRI/Info%20for%20newbies/Planning%20a%20scan%20session/Directions2MR8.docx?d=we6f6a1c73e5a42e3a01e98a8f0169e10&csf=1&web=1&e=GKJ4lb)). Note that this location is different from the other MR scanners in the hospital (MR suite E600).
- There is no cell phone service inside the MR suite. You can use the phone in the control room. If you want to call a non-KUL number, dail 0 followed by the external number.
- You can find relevant phone numbers to call for urgent questions as well as usernames and passwords of the PCs in the scan console room in [this file](https://kuleuven.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/T0005824-Hoplab/Shared%20Documents/Hoplab/Research/MRI/Info%20for%20newbies/Contact%20information,%20usernames%20and%20passwords.docx?d=w5f0acba0431d45eebb844daf31531222&csf=1&web=1&e=0dXkhV) in the Hoplab Teams folder.
- **After 6 pm and in the weekends there have to be 2 certified MR users (MRRUs) present to run a scan session** (see the [`Safety notes, rules & procedures`](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/6hdu5z594ojaxh2/AAATYJes74w8KvI0OEOd1MmYa?e=5&preview=Safety+Rules++Procedures+Research+MRI+UZL-KUL+v3.2.pdf) document).

**TODO:** add hospital checklist + other forms

**TODO:** we need to populated this with specific instructions on everything that needs to be done at the hospital. e.g., coils and headphones connections + how to check whether it is correctly connected, projector, eye-tracker; sign forms, check in, how to reach the scanning room, PCs (scan, task, ET), make sure everything is connected correctly (headphones, coil, ET), etc. follow/link the MRI checklist. which speaker to use? the black one with the white hp, connected top right

**NOTE:** coil/headphones connections: the top left plug is for the headphones. bottom left and top right for the coil (need to connect the 2 big wires coming out of the scanner)

**TODO:** add info on how to save images to disk, and describe the filename anon process

**NOTE:** I am not sure whether the more "admin" info should be here or not. If the full info should **not** be here (and be for example in 'Get started' or similar pages), we should definitely link it here. Anyone starting with fMRI should have **all* the relevant information in this section, without jumping from one page/section to the other. Edit Klara: I think everything from the doc fMRI protocol_MR8_October2019 should go here.

**TODO:** Since the hospital signage changed recently, might be useful to include updated directions with pictures

**TODO:** fix lay-out of this page

## On arrival of the participant

### Participant registration

- The volunteer has to register at the main entrance of the hospital when entering in one of the following ways:

	- Belgian eID-card: The participant can use the kiosks (or the Mynexuzhealth app). 
	- No Belgian eID card: The participant has to go to the registration desks (opening hours: 7am - 6.30pm). 
	- Children <12 y.o.: Have to register with their Kids-ID or ISI+ card (issued to people with Belgian Social Security but without a Belgian ID). 

- If the volunteer arrives before 5.30pm, they can go to the waiting room of the Radiology department (opening hours: 7am - 5.30 pm). 

	- If not yet done, the participant now needs to fill out the MR Safety Checklist (which you can find in Dutch, French and English in the [MRI Dropbox folder](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/6hdu5z594ojaxh2/AAATYJes74w8KvI0OEOd1MmYa?e=5)) and register themselves in "Wachtzaal Radiologie". The secretary will ask for the screening questionnaire and scan it to the participant's medical file. The participant has to bring the questionnaire back to the MRI scanner (now with a stamp saying "ingescand").
	- Remark: If you fail to do this, it is possible that your volunteer will not be listed in the RIS.

- If the volunteer arrives after 5.30pm, they can directly go to the waiting room of MR suite E408. 

### Welcoming the participant

- Start with giving an explanation of the task and method. If there are particular types of stimuli, it is best to bring a piece of paper showing examples of the stimuli or even show/let them practice one or more trials to familiarize them with the task and stimuli.
- Participants needs to wait in the waiting area while signing the consent form and MR Safety Checklist before entering the Controlled Areas. If a volunteer has several sessions planned, you can keep the same consent form, just let them date and sign the form each time. 
- Family and/or accompanists of the participant that need to enter the Inner Controlled Area also need to be screened using the MR Safety Checklist.
- Ask if the volunteers might want to use the bathroom before going into the scanner (the orange door across the control room). 
- Make sure that neither you nor the volunteer have any metal or magnetic items on their body! Remove watches, hairclips, bank cards, festival bracelets, belts, phones, etc. If the person doesn’t want to take off a festival bracelet, then you can put tape around the metal piece. 
- Do not forget to fill out the check-in part of the check-in/out form. 
- Optional: You can offer the participant something to drink and/or eat. 

## Preparation of the scanner area

### General remarks
 
- You can store your personal belongings in the lockers (no. 1 on the [map of MR8 suite](https://kuleuven.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/T0005824-Hoplab/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BE6F6A1C7-3E5A-42E3-A01E-98A8F0169E10%7D&file=Directions2MR8.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true)). 
- When leaving the technical room, always lock the door between the technical room and the scanner room to be sure it is properly locked. If it isn’t locked properly, then the scan console will present an error when you want to start scanning.  

### Stimulus PC 

- Log in using the username and password provided [here](https://kuleuven.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/T0005824-Hoplab/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B5F0ACBA0-431D-45EE-BB84-4DAF31531222%7D&file=Contact%20information%2C%20usernames%20and%20passwords.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true). If it is impossible to get the password accepted, the language settings might be incorrect (qwerty-azerty conversion problem). Press alt-shift and make sure "EN" is marked on the startup screen.
- Folders including your experiments can be stored in `C:\Research\Psychology\` (make your own folder here).
- The desktop PC of the stimulus computer is located in the technical room.
- Matlab 2011b, 2015a and Psychtoolbox version 3.0.123 are installed on this computer. Sometimes Matlab gives a JAVA error or the Matlab screen freezes after closing the experiment. Restarting Matlab should solve the problem.
- The screen resolution of this PC is 1920  x 1080 (landscape). Flipping of the screen can be done by changing the settings of the projector instead of changing the options on the computer!

### Trigger boxes

- The scanner sends a trigger '5' to the stimulus computer.
- The trigger box for **static stimuli** consists of one wire connecting two button boxes with 2 buttons each:
	
	- Box one: blue button = trigger 1 & yellow button = trigger 2
	- Box two: green button = trigger 3 & red button = trigger 4

- The trigger boxes for **dynamic stimuli** (e.g., movies) consists of one response box with 4 buttons:

	- Blue button: trigger "b"
	- Yellow button: trigger "y"
	- Green button: trigger "g"
	- Red button: trigger "r"

- **Before you start the experiment, check if the buttons you need give the expected output on the screen of the stimulus PC!**. 
- If there are no triggers, this can be caused by settings used by other groups. Try to restart Matlab and/or the stimulus computer. Another possibility is that some cables were left disconnected, so try to reconnect them if you can! The response box is located on top of the stimulus desktop PC in the technical room. Make sure both cables of the trigger box are correctly connected:

### Scanner table

- Cover the cushions with paper towel.
- Don’t place any cushions or equipment on the floor. If you see any cushions on the floor, please put them in a more appropriate place (for example on one of the shelves). 
- If clinical studies were done, the set-up at the patient table might be incorrect. The correct set-up is the following:
	
	- The 32-channel coil should be on the table (~10cm from the edge of the table).
	- The coil should be plugged in at the top of the patient table (lower plug on the left and upper plug on the right).  
	- The bottom of the coil needs to be in the correct position, slotted onto the patient table.
	- The headphones should be plugged in at the top of the patient table (upper plug on the left). 
	- The panic button should be plugged in at the bottom of the patient table (on the left).

- If you run out of supplies in the scanner room, you can take new ones from the closet which is in front of you when you enter MR suite E408 (paper rolls are stored on top).   

### Projection screen

- The projection screen should remain at the same location, i.e., the back of the screen aligned with the black marks on the scanner table. 
- Never touch the projection side of the screen, it is very easily damaged! If you want to move the screen, please use the plastic stand at the bottom. 

### Projector filter

- Make sure the same filter (**filter 3NB**) is used for each of your scan sessions by checking whether this filter is placed in front of the projector. 
- There are 4 different filters at MR8 with different strengths (i.e., the % of light from the projector reaching the projector screen):  

	- 3NB = 1.34%  
	- A+B = 4.27% 
	- A+C = 4.86% 
	- Filter without a name / grey tape = 69.3% 

- It is possible to use more than one filter to acquire the preferred luminance.  
- Different filters are stored in the top left drawer of the cabinet in the scanner room. 
- The filters are damaged fairly quickly so always hold the filter at the frame instead of touching it directly.  

### Projector

- The brand of the projector is NEC. Use the remote next to the projector to switch it on (button on the top right of the remote).
- If the projector lens is not in the correct position, don’t touch the lens! Use the buttons on the projector next to the lens to move the lens up/down and left/right.  
- If the projection on the screen isn’t showing the same window as on the stimulus computer screen (no window/blue screen): 
	- Check if the cable of the projector is still correctly connected to the stimulus computer.  
	- Check if the source is set at Display Port. You can reset this by pressing the button DisplayPort on the remote. This should set the settings back to “standard, presentation”. You can double check this by pressing the menu button on the remote which will show the settings of the projector.  
 	- Remark: When you want to look at the settings of the projector, you will have to go into the scanner area with the remote to see the menu options on the screen. Take the filter out, and hold the remote in the tube when you want to redirect through the projector options.
