# Hospital protocols and information

Here we will add all the info about the hospital, bookings, rooms, contact people, parking tickets (??), etc.

You should be heading to the hospital with three forms in hand:
 1. A **consent form** for your study. Make sure it is signed before the scanning session by your participant and yourself, and keep it safe after the study. Find an example here (TODO: link an example/blank consent form for fMRI).
 2. A **screening questionnaire** for MR examination. This can be found here (TODO: link to the patient questionnaire, in the dropbox?) and has to be filled in before heading to the MR suite. You can send it in advance to your participant so that they fill it before getting to the hospital. Consider sending it in advance, as some entries on the questionnaire will determine whether the scan can take place or not. This form needs to be handed in at the radiology welcome desk (right? I can't remember nor confirm this). Keep it with you and leave it in the scanner room, on the dedicated tray for screening questionnaires on the main desk.
 3. A **check-in, check-out form** this one has to be filled in a first time as you enter the MR suite, and a second time as you finish your scan. The timings you indicate on there will be used to record our usage of the scanner and the amount of hours to pay for. Leave this form on the dedicated tray, next to that of the screening questionnaires.

**TODO:** add hospital checklist + other forms

**TODO:** we need to populated this with specific instructions on everything that needs to be done at the hospital. e.g., coils and headphones connections + how to check whether it is correctly connected, projector, eye-tracker; sign forms, check in, how to reach the scanning room, PCs (scan, task, ET), make sure everything is connected correctly (headphones, coil, ET), etc. follow/link the MRI checklist. which speaker to use? the black one with the white hp, connected top right

**NOTE:** coil/headphones connections: the top left plug is for the headphones. bottom left and top right for the coil (need to connect the 2 big wires coming out of the scanner)

**TODO:** add info on how to save images to disk, and describe the filename anon process

**NOTE:** I am not sure whether the more "admin" info should be here or not. If the full info should **not** be here (and be for example in 'Get started' or similar pages), we should definitely link it here. Anyone starting with fMRI should have **all* the relevant information in this section, without jumping from one page/section to the other.
