# Hospital protocols and information

Here we will add all the info about the hospital, bookings, rooms, contact people, parking tickets (??), etc.

**TODO:** add hospital checklist + other forms

**TODO:** we need to populated this with specific instructions on everything that needs to be done at the hospital. e.g., coils and headphones connections + how to check whether it is correctly connected, projector, eye-tracker; sign forms, check in, how to reach the scanning room, PCs (scan, task, ET), make sure everything is connected correctly (headphones, coil, ET), etc. follow/link the MRI checklist. which speaker to use? the black one with the white hp, connected top right

**NOTE:** coil/headphones connections: the top left plug is for the headphones. bottom left and top right for the coil (need to connect the 2 big wires coming out of the scanner)

**TODO:** add info on how to save images to disk, and describe the filename anon process

**NOTE:** I am not sure whether the more "admin" info should be here or not. If the full info should **not** be here (and be for example in 'Get started' or similar pages), we should definitely link it here. Anyone starting with fMRI should have **all* the relevant information in this section, without jumping from one page/section to the other.
