## Participant Arrival and Registration

### Participant Registration

Upon arriving at the hospital, participants must register at the **main entrance**. The registration procedure varies depending on whether they hold a Belgian ID:

- **Belgian eID-card**: Use the self-service kiosks or the Mynexuzhealth app for fast registration.
- **No Belgian eID-card**: Participants must visit the registration desks (open from 7:00 AM to 6:30 PM).
- **Children under 12**: Register using a **Kids-ID** or **ISI+ card** (for those with Belgian Social Security but without a Belgian ID).

Participants must wait at the **main entrance at least 30 minutes before** their scheduled scanning session. A researcher will meet them and guide them through the check-in process.

=== "Weekdays (before 5:30 PM)"
    The researcher will guide the participant through the process, ensuring that:

    - The **MR Safety Checklist** and **Consent Form** are completed at the hospital entrance. Family members or anyone accompanying the participant into the Inner Controlled Area must also complete the **MR Safety Checklist**.
    - The **MR Safety Checklist** is submitted at the **"Wachtzaal Radiologie"** registration desk.
    - The secretary scans the participant's screening questionnaire into their medical file.
    - The researcher brings the stamped questionnaire to the MRI scanner.

    !!! warning "Important"
        The **MR Safety Checklist** must be submitted **at the Radiology desk**. Failure to do so will prevent the participant from being listed in the **Radiology Information System (RIS)**, which could cause delays.

=== "After 5:30 PM or Weekends/Holidays"
    - The **MR Safety Checklist** and **Consent Form** are completed at the hospital entrance.
    - The researcher and participant will proceed directly to the MR8 suite together.

!!! danger "Controlled Areas Access"
    Access to the Controlled Areas (MRI suite) is restricted and requires a KU Leuven card. Participants are not permitted to enter these areas until the **MR Safety Checklist** and **Consent Form** are signed.

### Trigger Boxes

The scanner sends a trigger "5" to the stimulus computer. Different setups are used for static and dynamic stimuli:

=== "Static Stimuli"
    A single wire connects two button boxes, each with 2 buttons:

      - **Box 1**: 
        - Blue button = Trigger 1
        - Yellow button = Trigger 2
      - **Box 2**: 
        - Green button = Trigger 3
        - Red button = Trigger 4

=== "Dynamic Stimuli (e.g., movies)"
    A response box with 4 buttons:

      - Blue button = Trigger "b"
      - Yellow button = Trigger "y"
      - Green button = Trigger "g"
      - Red button = Trigger "r"

!!! warning "Check Trigger Outputs"
    Before starting the experiment, verify that the buttons provide the expected outputs on the stimulus PC screen. If no triggers are working:

    - Restart Matlab and/or the stimulus computer.
    - Check if any cables have been left disconnected. The **response box** is on top of the stimulus desktop PC in the **control room**. Ensure both cables are properly connected.

     Do not place cushions or equipment on the floor. If any are found on the floor, place them on the shelves.

3. **Patient Table Setup**:
    - The **32-channel coil** should be placed ~10 cm from the edge of the table.
    - Coil connections:  
        - **Left lower plug** and **right upper plug**.
    - **Headphones**:  
      Plug into the upper left connector at the top of the table.
    - **Panic Button**:  
      Plug into the lower left connector at the bottom of the table.

!!! info "Running Low on Supplies?"
    If you run out of supplies (e.g., paper towels), you can find new ones in the closet right in front of you when entering **MR suite E408**. Paper rolls are stored on top.

---

### Projection Screen

- **Correct Position**:  
    Ensure the back of the screen is aligned with the black marks on the scanner table.
  
- **Handling**:  
    Never touch the projection side of the screen. Use the plastic stand at the bottom if you need to move it.

---

### Projector Filter

Ensure that **filter 3NB** (1.34% light transmission) is placed in front of the projector tunnel for consistency across scan sessions.

MR8 offers four filter options, each with different light transmission levels:

   | **Filter**             | **Light Transmission** |
   |------------------------|------------------------|
   | 3NB                    | 1.34%                  |
   | A+B                    | 4.27%                  |
   | A+C                    | 4.86%                  |
   | Unnamed (grey tape)    | 69.3%                  |

You can combine filters to adjust the luminance.

!!! tip "Handle Filters with Care"
    Filters are fragile. Always hold them by the frame to avoid damage. Filters are stored in the top left drawer of the cabinet in the scanner room.

---

### Projector Usage

1. **Powering On**:  
   The projector brand is **NEC**. Use the remote (button on the top right) to turn it on.

2. **Adjusting the Lens**:  
   If the lens is out of position, use the buttons next to the lens on the projector to adjust — **do not touch the lens directly**.

#### Common Issues

## Getting the Volunteer Ready for the Scanner

### Earplugs and Headphones

Volunteers **must** wear earplugs and white earphones. New white earpad covers can be found:

- On top of the cabinet to the right
- Inside the cabinet in the hallway (enter, go straight, then turn right)

!!! danger "Mandatory Hearing Protection"
    Volunteers who refuse to wear the provided hearing protection **cannot** be scanned.

---

### Coil Setup

1. **Positioning the Volunteer**:
    - Ask the volunteer to lie down on the patient table with their head fitted inside the coil.
    - Ensure they don’t hit their head when positioning.
    - Place a **knee cushion** under the volunteer's legs for comfort.

2. **Head Stability**:
    - Secure the volunteer's head using **washcloths** placed between the sides of the head and the coil.
    - Make sure the volunteer is comfortable, ensuring the washcloths do not apply too much pressure.

3. **Panic Button**:
    - Attach the **panic button** to the volunteer's clothing (within easy reach).
    - **Do not place it in their hand**.  
    - Explain its operation and test the alarm before starting the session.

4. **Response Button Box**:
    - Hand the **response button box** to the volunteer and **repeat instructions** on which buttons to use.

5. **Positioning the Coil**:
    - Place the **top of the coil** onto the bottom part, ensuring the volunteer's **nose/head is not touching** the coil.
    - Align the volunteer’s **eyebrows with the calibration line** on the coil. This ensures the head is positioned at the center of the magnet.
    - Secure the coil by clipping it with the **gray handle**.

---

### Mirror and Screen Alignment

!!! tip "Preferred Mirror"
    Use the **single square-shaped mirror** (preferred for better resolution over the double mirror).

1. **Attach the Mirror**:
    - Slide the mirror on top of the head coil.
    - There are two ways to align it easily:
      - Click the mirror on and slide it forward to block the calibration light. Then, adjust and insert the volunteer.
      - Align the mirror, click it on, adjust the position, and insert the volunteer.

2. **Volunteer Adjustment**:
    - The volunteer can **adjust the mirror** themselves if needed by sliding it backward or forward to get a clear view of the screen.

---

### Table calibration

The **control panels** on the left and right of the scanner have identical functions. Use the same switch to move the table **up/down** and **backward/forward**.

1. **Table Height**:
    - If the table is down, raise it by pressing the **up button** until it stops at the maximum height.
  
2. **Moving the Table Inside**:
    - Use the **up button** to move the table inside the scanner.

3. **Eye Protection**:
    - Ask the volunteer to **close their eyes** and gently cover their eyes with your hand.

4. **Calibration Laser**:
    - Press the button with the **light bulb icon** to activate the red calibration laser.
    - Line up the laser with the **volunteer’s eyebrows**.  
    !!! tip
        If the laser turns off, press the button again to reactivate it.

5. **Confirm Coil Position**:
    - Press the button below the light bulb button to confirm the coil's position (a green light will indicate confirmation).
    - The table will move automatically into the scanner when the button is held for a few seconds.
    !!! note
        Place the mirror on top of the coil before sliding the volunteer into the scanner.

#### Common Issues

??? failure "Table Calibration Failed"
    - If the table moves too far inside the scanner, calibration may have failed. Slide the table out of the scanner, recalibrate, and try again.
    - If the scanner light remains on, use the control buttons to switch it off.
    - For **fMRI studies**, maintain consistent lighting throughout the session by using the outer circle on the control panel to switch the light on or off.

??? failure "Green Calibration Light Already On"
    - If the green calibration light is already on before positioning the table correctly, move the table out of the scanner to reset the calibration. The light will turn off, allowing you to restart the calibration process.

---

### Inserting the Volunteer into the Scanner

1. **Move the Table**:
    - Use the **backward/forward switch** to move the table into the scanner. The table will stop automatically when it reaches the correct position according to the calibration.

2. **Cable Management**:
    - Hold the cables while moving the volunteer to prevent them from stretching.

3. **Comfort Check**:
    - Ensure the volunteer is comfortable in the scanner, without crossed arms or legs (to avoid forming current loops).
    - Make sure **no metal or wires** are touching the volunteer’s skin or the bore of the scanner.
    - No wires should be looped within the scanner bore.

#### Common Issues

??? failure "Mirror Doesn’t Fit in the Bore"
    - Check if the **washcloths** are stuck between the edges of the coil, as this could lift the coil's top.
    - Ensure the bottom part of the coil is properly slotted into the grooves on the table.

??? failure "Table Doesn’t Move"
    - The table might be disconnected. Press the button located at the **bottom right**, next to the red button (Button 2), to reconnect the table.

??? failure "Table Moves Too Far Inside Scanner"
