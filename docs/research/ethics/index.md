# General information on the ethical procedure

Before you can start your study, you will need to apply for ethical approval - at least in case your study is not covered by one of the existing approved projects.

- For **(f)MRI and/or patient studies and/or studies carried out at UZ Leuven**, you need to file an application at the [Ethical committee research UZ/KU Leuven (EC onderzoek)](https://www.uzleuven.be/nl/ethische-commissie/onderzoek). Most of the research done in our lab falls under prospective academic monocentric research, for which you can find the application guidelines [here](https://www.uzleuven.be/nl/ethische-commissie-onderzoek/prospectieve-studies/experiment/academisch-monocentrisch).
- For **behavioral or tDCS studies**, which do not fall under the Human Experiments Act, you need to file an application at the [Social and Societal Ethics Committee (SMEC)](https://www.kuleuven.be/english/research/ethics/committees/smec) via the [PRET (PRivacy and EThics) platform](https://www.groupware.kuleuven.be/sites/pret/Pages/default.aspx).
- If your research is close to another study that has already been approved within UZ/KU Leuven, you can also cover the necessary ethical requirements by filing for an **amendment** to the existing approval (which is considerably less time-consuming).

It is important to know that in any case, your study cannot begin until it has been approved. If you are hesitating whether and/or where you should apply for ethical approval for your project, you can consult this [decision tree](https://research.kuleuven.be/en/integrity-ethics/ethics/committees/smec/documenten-1/beslissingsboom/DecisionTreeENG).
Examples of previous applications can be found in [this folder](https://kuleuven.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/T0005824-Hoplab/Shared%20Documents/Hoplab/Research/Ethical%20applications?csf=1&web=1&e=cDpsg3) of the lab's Teams channel.
