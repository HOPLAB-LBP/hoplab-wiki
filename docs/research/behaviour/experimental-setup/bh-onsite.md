# On-site experiments

---

## Preparation

On-site experiments can vary depending on the participant population you are approaching and the format of the experiment.
For recruitment from the Psychology Bachelor Student population, please see information on recruitment via EMS [here](https://hoplab-lbp.github.io/hoplab-wiki/research/behaviour/bh-participants.html). After setting up an account, you will need to set up your experiment on SONA, which is also explained on that page. Once you have completed all steps on that page, you can continue here:

## Room reservations
There are two types of rooms you can book with their respective system.

**1) If you are a (thesis) student or in need of PC rooms**

In KU Loket, go to HSE and spaces > Classroom reservations (Dutch only) > Zoek op naam > “PSI” or "VHI"

For a **room with PC's** you might opt for a room in VHI. Pick one of the “ICTS PC-KLAS”-rooms (and mind the room capacity). In the pop-up that opens, select 'Bekijk de bezetting van dit lokaal' (3rd option under “meer informatie”) to check the availability.

!!!tip
  If needed, reserve a room at least 20 minutes prior to the first experiment of the day, so you have time to set up the PCs, and 15 minutes after the last experiment of the day in order to clean up. Make sure to also leave 15 minutes between 2 groups of participants so you can set up the computers again.

🡪 To book a room, email <ying.cai@kuleuven.be> with the specific date(s) and hours.

**2) To book experiment rooms located in the basement of PSI**

Use Calira for booking Experiment cubicles, TMS rooms, etc. For more information see: (<https://hoplab-lbp.github.io/hoplab-wiki/get-started/admin-procedures.html?h=calir#reserve-equipment-or-a-room-for-testing>)

## Add timeslots to your SONA study
On the EMS home page, go to View, add or edit timeslots. In your list of studies, click Timeslots on the right of your study name. You can choose to add a timeslot or to add multiple timeslots.

## Informed consents
Print out as many ICFs as you will test participants.
Store the signed ICFs in a locked closet or as described by your RDM plan.

__TODO__: Add comprehensive practical information for running on-site behavioural experiments. Specifically:
  1. Equipment setup procedures: how to configure testing booth PCs, connect response devices, set screen resolution and refresh rate, and launch experiment software.
  2. Participant management during sessions: greeting protocol, consent form procedure, how to assign participant IDs, how to handle late arrivals and no-shows.
  3. Data collection and backup procedures: where raw data files are saved, how to verify data integrity after each session, and how to back up data to the lab server or external drive the same day.
  4. Troubleshooting common issues: what to do if the experiment crashes, if a PC freezes, if Calira booking conflicts arise, or if equipment malfunctions.
  5. Session timing and scheduling tips: recommended buffer time between participants, how to handle back-to-back sessions, and end-of-day cleanup checklist.
