# On-site experiments

---

## Preparation

On-site experiements can vary depeinding on the participant population you are approaching and the format of the experiment. 
For recruitment from the Psychology Bachelor Student poulation please see information on recruitment via EMS - please see the page on [Participant Recuitment](https://hoplab-lbp.github.io/hoplab-wiki/research/behaviour/bh-participants.html). After setting up an account you will need to set up your experiment on SONA also explained there. 
Once you have completed all steps on that page you can continue here: 

## Room reservations
In KU Loket, go to HSE and spaces > Classroom reservations (Dutch only) > Zoek op naam > “PSI” or "VHI"

For an **room with PC's** you might opt for a room in VHI. Pick one of the “ICTS PC-KLAS”-rooms (and mind the room capacity). In the pop-up that opens, select 'Bekijk de bezetting van dit lokaal' (3rd option under “meer informatie”) to check the availability.


!!!tip
  If needed, Reserve a room at least 20 minutes prior to the first experiment of the day, so you have time to set up the PCs, and 15 minutes after the last experiment of the day in order to clean up. Make sure to also leave 15 minutes between 2 groups of participants so you can set up the computers again.

🡪 To book a room, email ying.cai@kuleuven.be with the specific date(s) and hours.

## Add timeslots to your SONA study
On the EMS home page, go to View, add or edit timeslots. In your list of studies, click Timeslots on the right of your study name. You can choose to add a timeslot or to add multiple timeslots.
