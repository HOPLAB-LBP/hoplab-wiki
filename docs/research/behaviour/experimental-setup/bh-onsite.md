# On-site experiments

This page provides information on how to practically organize your on-site experiment. On-site experiments typically require a room and participants. 

## Testing rooms

We have access to several testing rooms, in PSI (cubicles) as well as VHI (mock scanner room).

## Participants

Participants for on-site testing can be recruited as described 
[here](docs/research/behaviour/bh-participants.md)

__TODO__: KLARA: Information on testing rooms still needs to be added by Klara.
