# Research Data Management (RDM) at Hoplab

Welcome to this brand-new section that describes how Hoplab handles research data during the full project lifecycle: from onboarding and data collection to storage, sharing, and archiving.

Our procedures aim to ensure:

- consistent, reproducible and well-organised datasets across projects
- compliance with [KU Leuven RDM policy](https://www.kuleuven.be/rdm/en/policy), [FAIR principles](https://www.kuleuven.be/rdm/en/guidance/fair), relevant ethical guidelines, and [GDPR](https://admin.kuleuven.be/privacy/en/studpers/gdpr-code-of-conduct)
- secure handling of confidential participant data
- efficient collaboration and long-term preservation

## ⚠️ Work in progress

Some procedures are still being tested or refined.
Check the [**Temporary guidelines**](current.md) page for the currently recommended practices.

If anything is unclear or missing, please contact the RDM responsible ([Klara](https://www.kuleuven.be/wieiswie/nl/person/00116473) or [Andrea](https://www.kuleuven.be/wieiswie/nl/person/00152046)) so the documentation can be improved.
