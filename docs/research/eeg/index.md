# EEG (Electroencephalography)

We have access to two EEG devices that fall under the NeuroSPACE consortium.

The first one is a mobile EEG system, currently used mostly by the [Neuropsychology Lab](https://www.neuropsychologylab.be/) ([C. Gillebert](https://www.kuleuven.be/wieiswie/en/person/00049589)).

The second EEG apparatus is a high-resolution EEG system, used primarily by the [Hoplab](https://www.hoplab.be/) and the [Desenderlab](https://desenderlab.com/). This is a 128-channel system of BioSemi.

The 128-channel EEG is located in room PSI 02.52. It can be booked through the Clustermarket system (see general Research pages), where you can find it as "BioSemi EEG Lab 00.52".

In the Hoplab we typically set up experiments for multivariate EEG ("Representational Dynamics"). Our standard analysis pipeline is described most in detail in [Chen et al.](https://direct.mit.edu/imag/article/doi/10.1162/imag_a_00006/116700/The-representational-dynamics-of-the-animal) (2023, Imaging Neuroscience).

This publication is accompanied by an [OSF archive](https://osf.io/d5egu/) that contains the analysis code to do multivariate analysis with the help of Matlab and the [CosmoMVPA](https://www.cosmomvpa.org/) toolbox.

**TODO:** Add clustermarket info elsewhere;

**TODO:** Create sub-pages;

**TODO:** Add information on how to use the system and to acquire the data;

**TODO:** Add information on the analysis (OSF page of Chen et al has no readme!);

**TODO:** Also describe details of pre-processing (no pre-processing script on OSF);
