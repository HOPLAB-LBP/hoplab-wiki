# EEG data analysis

Here we give some instructions on how to analyse the data, from preprocessing to MVPA.

We also remind of some good practices to get good quality data.

<!--
=== EEG Analysis Page TODOs ===
This page should eventually mirror the fMRI analysis section structure, with a
step-by-step progression from raw data through final statistical results.

__TODO__: Document the preprocessing pipeline — filtering (band-pass, notch),
re-referencing (average reference), artifact detection and correction, ICA for
eye-blink/muscle artifact removal, epoching, and baseline correction. Reference
MNE-Python (for Python users) or EEGLAB (for MATLAB users) as tooling options.

__TODO__: Define quality control procedures — criteria for good vs bad data,
epoch rejection thresholds, and guidelines for excluding participants or channels.

__TODO__: Document the lab's standard multivariate analysis approach —
Representational Dynamics as described in Chen et al. (2023, Imaging Neuroscience)
and Leys et al. (2025, JoV), using CoSMoMVPA in MATLAB. Include decoding setup,
cross-validation scheme, and RSA procedures.

__TODO__: Describe statistical testing approaches — cluster-based permutation
tests, multiple comparison correction, and recommended toolboxes.

__TODO__: Link to the OSF archive (https://osf.io/d5egu/) containing analysis
code from Chen et al. (2023). Add explanatory context since the archive currently
has no README.

__TODO__: Provide an example end-to-end analysis workflow (raw data to results),
similar to the fMRI section's step-by-step progression.
