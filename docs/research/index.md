__TODO__: [Klara?] Add information on room booking, in particular ClusterMarket.

__TODO__: [Klara] Add more recommended software (e.g., Mendeley/Endnote, R, Text editors, Image editing software, Git, LaTeX, Pandoc, markdown, Python, Overleaf, RBA, BioSemi, PsychoPy, the labâ€™s own software?)

__TODO__: [Klara] Add info on interesting conferences to attend, suggested reading (books, papers, websites), suggested courses (soft skills, programming, EEG/fMRI, version control, stats, science, etc.)

__TODO__: [Klara] Add links to nice data visualisation tools and (AI) tools to find papers

__TODO__: [Klara] Add info on existing focus groups (e.g., EEG, MRI) which people can attend

__TODO__: [Klara] Make list of hardware available in/to the lab

__TODO__: [Klara] Explain how Lirias works/what it is used for

__TODO__: [Klara] Explain how to download papers from home

__TODO__: [Klara] Add context for the stuff on OSF and Github (touch on topics as open science, reproducibility)

__TODO__: [Klara] Add (general) info on how to store your data (eg BIDS) --> this is in the fmri section for now. perhaps we can link it?

__TODO__: [Klara] Refer to the resources for researchers on [this page](https://ppw.kuleuven.be/en/research/doing-research)
