This is the landing page for this section. Please populate it with appropriate information.

**TODO:** populate this landing page.

**TODO:** do we need more explicit information about the ethical procedure? and should this page be in this research section, or admin precedures? I think there is going to be some overlap about these two sections, and we need to think better what is included here and why and what in the more general get started section --> edit Klara: should be covered now, let me know what you think!

**TODO** ideas Klara
- Add more recommended software (e.g., Mendeley/Endnote, R, Text editors, Image editing software, Git, LaTeX, Pandoc, markdown, Python, Overleaf, RBA, BioSemi, PsychoPy, the labâ€™s own software?)
- Add info on interesting conferences to attend, suggested reading (books, papers, websites), suggested courses (soft skills, programming, EEG/fMRI, version control, stats, science, etc.)
- Add links to nice data visualisation tools and (AI) tools to find papers
- Add info on existing focus groups (e.g., EEG, MRI) which people can attend
- Make list of hardware available in/to the lab
- Explain how Lirias works/what it is used for
- Explain how to download papers from home
- Add context for the stuff on OSF and Github (touch on topics as open science, reproducibility)
- Add (general) info on how to store your data (eg BIDS)
