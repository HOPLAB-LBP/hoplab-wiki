# Research at the Hoplab

Welcome to the central hub for all research activities at Hoplab. This page serves as your gateway to our research methodologies, data analysis procedures, and resources. Whether you're involved in behavioral studies, EEG, eye-tracking, or fMRI, you'll find the essential guidelines and workflows here.

__TODO__: [Klara] Add more recommended software (e.g., Mendeley/Endnote, R, Text editors, Image editing software, Git, LaTeX, Pandoc, Markdown, Python, Overleaf, RBA, BioSemi, PsychoPy, Pavlovia).

__TODO__: [Klara] Add info on interesting conferences to attend, suggested reading (books, papers, websites), suggested courses (soft skills, programming, EEG/fMRI, version control, stats, science, etc.). Part of this is already covered in the "Student Starter Pack" page.

__TODO__: [Klara] Add links to nice data visualisation tools and (AI) tools to find papers

__TODO__: [Klara] Add info on existing focus groups (e.g., EEG, MRI) which people can attend (e.g., within LBI)

__TODO__: [Klara] Make list of hardware available in/to the lab

__TODO__: [Klara] Explain how Lirias works/what it is used for

__TODO__: [Klara] Explain how to download papers from home

__TODO__: [Klara] Add context for the stuff on OSF and Github (touch on topics as open science, reproducibility)

__TODO__: [Klara] Add (general) info on how to store your data (eg BIDS) --> this is in the fmri section for now. perhaps we can link it? --> would wait until the end of the BADM consult process, perhaps we can make a page dedicated to RDM 

__TODO__: [Klara] Refer to the resources for researchers on [this page](https://ppw.kuleuven.be/en/research/doing-research)

__TODO__: [Klara] Make list of events throughout the year e.g. conferences, scicomm activities, days to remember (e.g., stroke day)
