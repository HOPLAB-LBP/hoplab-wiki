# Setting up your real life working environment

## Keys

Ask the LBP lab technician (As of August 2024, this is Ying Cai), whom you can find in room 02.37, for the key to your new office.

**TODO:** add link to KU Leuven who-is-who

## Staff card

The staff card (different from the student card if youâ€™re an intern or a PhD researcher) can be used to access the PSI building at all time. Just badge it on the card reader at the main entrance (Tiensestraat 102) when you need access outside of working hours.

## Phone

If you need to call or be called by external numbers, Skype for business can be used and also has a voicemail system associated to it. For good quality calls, you can use a headset, forward the calls to your personal phone number or opt for an old-school stationary phone linked to your Skype for business account (e.g., if you need to make a lot of calls and you only want to be reachable from your desk). You can get a phone from Ying Cai. If you do, make sure you submit the serial number [here](https://ppw.kuleuven.be/intranet/onlineform/lynctelefoon). 

## Other

For each new member, a laptop and other pc material (e.g., an external hard drive, computer screen, mouse, keyboard, etc.) will be ordered or be made available. If you are missing something, please contact [**PLACEHOLDER**] before ordering anything new.
