# Setting up your real life workspace

## Keys

Ask the LBP lab technician ([Ying Cai](https://www.kuleuven.be/wieiswie/en/person/00098752)), whom you can find in room 02.37, for a key to your new office.

## Staff card

The staff card (different from the student card if you’re an intern or a PhD researcher) can be used to access the PSI building at all time. Just badge it on the card reader at the main entrance (Tiensestraat 102) when you need access outside of working hours. You will receive it by mail in the first weeks of your contract.

If you have students working with you that need access to the office during the weekends or outside of working hours, get approval from [Hans](https://www.kuleuven.be/wieiswie/nl/person/00029058). Once the approval is in place, mail [Zsuzsa](https://www.kuleuven.be/wieiswie/nl/person/00048902) with the student names and their student cards attached. 

## Office set-up

For each new member, a laptop and other pc material (e.g., an external hard drive, computer screen, mouse, keyboard, etc.) will be ordered or be made available. If you are missing something or need something specific, please contact [Ying](https://www.kuleuven.be/wieiswie/en/person/00098752) with [Klara](https://www.kuleuven.be/wieiswie/nl/person/00116743) in CC.

## Phone

You can get a phone from [Ying](https://www.kuleuven.be/wieiswie/en/person/00098752). If you do, make sure you submit the serial number [here](https://ppw.kuleuven.be/intranet/onlineform/lynctelefoon).


## Broader research environment

Within the Faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences, Brain and Cognition (B&C, headed by [Ralf Krampe](https://www.kuleuven.be/wieiswie/nl/person/00046921)) is a research unit dedicated to the experimental and neuroscientific study of psychological functions and metacognition. B&C consists of several research groups, each specializing in specific themes and methodologies. One of these is the Laboratory of Biological Psychology (LBP, led by [Rudi D'Hooge](https://www.kuleuven.be/wieiswie/nl/person/00043549)) which investigates the biological foundations of behaviour and cognition, including learning, memory, perception, motivation, and emotion. Hoplab is a subgroup within LBP, led by [Hans](https://www.kuleuven.be/wieiswie/nl/person/00029058). As a member of Hoplab, you will work closely with the broader LBP team.

An overview of the office spaces and who is located where, can be found [here](https://www.kuleuven.be/wieiswie/nl/person/00029058).

## Kitchen 

All member of Hoplab have access to the LBP-kitchen (shared with the labs of [Bram](https://www.kuleuven.be/wieiswie/nl/person/00035504), [Rudi](https://www.kuleuven.be/wieiswie/nl/person/00043549), and [Markus](https://www.kuleuven.be/wieiswie/nl/person/00140784)). The kitchen is located in PSI 02.53 and has a fridge, coffee machine, kettle, microwave, diswasher,... 

There is a rotation system (hanging in the kitchen) indicating two people every week who are responsible to clean the kitchen. 
- Please check the coffee, sugar, and milk supplies at least once a week. If anything is running low, inform [Ying](https://www.kuleuven.be/wieiswie/nl/person/00098752) in time so she can place a new order.
- Make sure the table and microwave are clean; wipe them down if necessary. The coffee room is occasionally used for general meetings (including meetings with external visitors), so it should always be presentable without last-minute cleaning.
- There are plenty of towels available. If any look dirty or worn, replace them. In particular, do not use a grimy towel to dry clean dishes when unloading the dishwasher.
