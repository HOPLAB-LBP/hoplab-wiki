# Student starter pack

If you're a student newly starting in the lab, this page is made for you. It is packed with resources and knowledge that you will find useful during your time with us. Enjoy!

The starter pack is divided into three sections. In no order of importance, you will find **important papers** from authors we might refer to every once in a while, **coding tutorials** to get up to speed with Python and develop your programming skills, and **miscellaneous** resources that don't fit in these two categories but are still relevant.

## Coding tutorials

Developing strong coding skills is crucial for success in our lab. Here are some excellent resources to help you improve your Python programming and data science skills:

1. :star: **[The Good Research Code Handbook](https://goodresearch.dev/)**: This is a must-read for anyone joining the lab. It covers essential knowledge on how to structure and write your code in research, suitable for both beginners and experienced researchers.

2. [DataCamp Python Courses](https://www.datacamp.com/category/python): Interactive tutorials for beginners.

3. [Codecademy Python Classes](https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/language/python): Free classes to get started with Python.

4. [Software Carpentry Python Fundamentals](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/): Basic Python concepts for beginners.

5. [EdX: Using Python for Research](https://www.edx.org/learn/python/harvard-university-using-python-for-research): Free course on Python applications in research.

6. [Scientific Python Lectures](https://lectures.scientific-python.org/): Advanced course for confident programmers.

7. [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/): Comprehensive guide to data science with Python.
