# Student starter pack

If you're a student newly starting in the lab, this page is made for you. It is packed with resources and knowledge that you will find useful during your time with us. Enjoy!

The starter pack is divided into three sections. In no order of importance, you will find **important papers** from authors  we might refer to every once in a while, **coding tutorials** to get up to speed with Python and develop your programming skills, and **miscellaneous** resources that don't fit in these two categories but are still relevant.

=== "Some essential papers"

    Here are some foundational papers to give you some background on the research going on in the lab.

    **NOTE:** TIM: 'm not sure how to structure this? I thought we could have bullet points, with a bit of text explaining why each entry is important. ANDREA: I think this is ok, but we should definitely add links and more info for each paper. Depending on how fancy we want to be and how the final result looks like, we could also make a [table](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/data-tables/) or a [grid](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/grids/)

    #### Some reviews

    Bracci & Op de Beeck 2023

    Grill-Spector and Weiner 2014

    DiCarlo et al 2012
    
    #### Classic papers

    Felleman & Van Essen 1991

    #### fMRI studies we refer to

    Bracci et al. 2016, 2017
    
    Kriegeskorte et al 2008 (maybe fits in a different category)

    #### DNN papers

     - DNNs develop similar representations to the brain: Khaligh-Razavi and Kriegeskorte 2014, Yamins et al 2014
     - DNNs are biased towards texture: Geirhos et al 2022

=== "Some coding tutorials"

    **TODO:** once it is populated, we should refer (or even move this content) to the Research --> Coding section

    Here are some places where you'll find tutorials to learn some Python skills.

    1. [Datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/category/python) offers some nice interactive tutorials to get started.
    2. In a similar vein, [Code Academy](https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/language/python) has several free classes you can start from.
    3. Some Python fundamentals can be found in the [Software Carpentry](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/) website.
    4. Check out this free [Edx](https://www.edx.org/learn/python/harvard-university-using-python-for-research) course on Python for research.
    5. If you feel more confident, this [scientific Python](https://lectures.scientific-python.org/) course is for you.
    6. A strong, large recap on data science with Python can be found in [this handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/).

=== "Miscellaneous"

    If you're looking to understand the fundamentals of machine learning, and get a solid understanding of modeling, this [Coursera class](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction) is a must. It offers free, very high-quality contents.
    
    **TODO:** add some data visualisation resources? I think Laura S had some nice websites


    
    
**TODO:** format the paper list, add resources, ask members to contribute what they think is important for students starting in the lab.
