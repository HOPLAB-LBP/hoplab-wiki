# Admin 101

On this page, we will specify the procedures for the most common administrative procedures you might need to follow. If something is missing, please contact us so we can add it and keep this page up to date (and your lifes easier). 

**KU Loket** is the university portal through which many administrative things are done. You can access it [here](https://webwsp.aps.kuleuven.be/irj/portal). 

## Consult your personnel file

Log in to KU Loket and go to "Personnel", then click on "My details". 

At the very top of this page, you can find the name of your **HR advisor**. Your HR advisor offers you a listening ear, provides clarifying advice on HR-related matters and supports you with the administrative obligations that come along with employment at KU Leuven. 

Below, you can **edit your personal details**, such as adding a new private address, updating your family situation, adding emergency contacts or adding a new bank account number by clicking on the pencil in the top right corner of the corresponding section.

Browse through the **other tabs** to find out and/or change information on communication means, [insurances](https://admin.kuleuven.be/sab/vz/intranet/en/insurance-office) and [other financial advantages](https://admin.kuleuven.be/mykuleuven/en/theme/hr-wellbeing/salary-benefits-insurances/index) you are entitled to, your contract details, mobility (e.g., to order a [KU Leuven bike](https://admin.kuleuven.be/td/intranet/en/mobility/2WD/2wd), get a refund for [public transportation commuting costs](https://admin.kuleuven.be/personeel/english/intranet/salary-benefits-insurances/commuting/recovery-commuting-expenses), or to [register your personal vehicle for work use](https://admin.kuleuven.be/personeel/intranet/verloning-personeelsvoordelen/verplaatsingen_dienstverband/verplaatsing_dienstverband#section-2)) and your curriculum at KU Leuven.

Through your personnel file, you can also apply for a [bicycle allowance](https://admin.kuleuven.be/personeel/english/intranet/salary-benefits-insurances/commuting/bicycle-allowance) if you bike (part of) your home-work journey and/or apply for [teleworking allowances](https://admin.kuleuven.be/personeel/english/intranet/workinghours-teleworking/hybrid-working/allowances-and-registration/index) (for KU Leuven staff only). If you are financed by FWO, check out [this page](https://admin.kuleuven.be/mykuleuven/en/channel/mk108/index). If you are looking for information on the parking policy of KU Leuven, go [here](https://admin.kuleuven.be/td/en/mobility/parking-policy).

## Register personal leave

There are a couple of things we usually do in the lab when we take a holiday:

1. **Notify Hans** by sending an email with the subject "Holiday", to keep an official trace of your holiday request (that also helps him keep track of who’s on leave). 
2. Note the days you’re off in the Hoplab **Google calendar**, so everyone is aware of your absence. 
3. **Notify your employer**, which can be different depending on your contract (the procedure below is for KU Leuven employees, for instance).

#### Procedure for KU Leuven employees
The procedure for KU Leuven employees is as follows (If you are financed by FWO, check out [this page](https://admin.kuleuven.be/mykuleuven/en/channel/mk108/index)). When you plan your holiday, you have to register this in KU Loket and get it approved. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Log in to KU Loket and go to "**Personnel**"
2. Navigate to "**My Leave**" and click on "**Requesting leave**"
3. Click on a day and fill in the appropriate start and end date of your holiday period
4. Click on the arrow, choose how many hours of each type of leave you are entitled to you want to use
5. Submit your request to your approver

To register **other kinds of personal leave** (e.g., [short-term or social leave](https://admin.kuleuven.be/personeel/english/intranet/holiday-absence/short-leave) or [sick leave](https://admin.kuleuven.be/personeel/english/intranet/holiday-absence/illness-accident/incapacity-to-work-illness)), check out the corresponding links. For further questions on this topic, browse to [this page](https://admin.kuleuven.be/mykuleuven/en/theme/hr-wellbeing/holidays-leaves-of-absence).

## Register professional leave

This has to be done (in advance) for absence in the context of **any work-related event** (national and international), such as a conference or the annual LBP retreat. This registration is needed in order to claim professional expenses made during this trip, to make sure you are correctly insured and to allow the KU Leuven to monitor the safety level of the trip.

Proceed as follows:

1. Log in to KU Loket and Go to "**Personnel**"
2. Navigate to "**Register missions**" and click on "**New request**"
3. Fill out the required information on 
	- *When* you will be absent
	- *Where* you will be
	- *How* you will get there
	- *Why* you are going 
4. Add the correct financial antenna to the form (An Van Kets, u0057838)
5. Submit the form

**TODO:** add link to an van kets page, or mailto.

For more information, check out [this page](https://admin.kuleuven.be/personeel/english/intranet/holiday-absence/absences_university_business). If you are using your own vehicle for the trip, please make sure it is registered for insurance reasons. To do so, follow the steps on [this page](https://admin.kuleuven.be/personeel/english/intranet/salary-benefits-insurances/workrelated-trips/reimbursement_workrelated_trip#section-2).

## How to reserve a room for a meeting

In order to book a room, contact Ying Cai. You can check which rooms are available yourself through KU Loket:

1. Go to KU Loket, navigate to the tab "HSE & Spaces" and click on "Classroom reservations" (Dutch only) 
2. Click "Selecteer lokalen" and create the following selection to see all the rooms in the PSI: 

	<img src="assets/roomreservations.png" alt="Test" width="350" height="450" />

3. Select the rooms that fit your needs
4. Click "toon reservaties" twice
5. Browse to the date & time when you need the room
6. Look for an available room and send this info to *ying.cai@kuleuven.be* 

## How to reserve equipment or a room for testing

The standard booking tool for testing rooms and equipment (testing booths, EEG caps, etc.) since 2023 is **Clustermarket**. You can log in to the website using your KU Leuven credentials. To do so, choose "Log in via your organisation" and type "KU Leuven". You will be automatically redirected.

When you are logged in, click "join lab" on your dashboard and search for "HopLab"/"HOPLAB" (**check which one is correct once you have permission + add info on who is supposed to grant you permission**)

Make sure to use this website to book your testing time slots when you use common rooms or material. Request access to the items you don’t have permission to in case you need it.

## How to order stuff

Please contact Ying for assistance with arranging and/or ordering and/or paying for the following things:

- Hotel reservations
- Flight bookings
- Online purchases
- Computer equipment
- Physical mail and packages (post)

**General orders** (e.g., milk, coffee, office material) are also handled by Ying Cai. In case of bigger purchases, make sure to include the financial antenna (An Van Kets) in the process. 

The IT department handles orders related to **computer supplies** (*ppw.dict@kuleuven.be*). All [computer equipment](https://admin.kuleuven.be/sab/ic/intranet/en/operatingcosts/operating-costs-details/computer-accessories) needs to be bought through the [official university providers](https://admin.kuleuven.be/td/aankoop/intranet/english/discounts/ICT/computeraccessories) by the financial antenna (An Van Kets). Therefore, when computer supplies need to be bought, make sure to contact them both. It can also be useful to include Ying Cai in CC in that case. 

If you need **technical assistance** for your order (e.g., you want to order an EEG-cap), you can contact Klara or send an email to *neurospace@kuleuven.be* (general mailing address to reach the support staff of the Methusalem project).

## How to arrange a parking spot for a visitor

- If you need to arrange parking for a visitor in the **city center**, you can do so by requesting a day code for the visitor to operate the barriers of the KU Leuven personnel parkings. For more information, check out [this page](https://admin.kuleuven.be/td/intranet/en/fd/bws/parking-policy#section-8). It is worth noting that the car park underneath the Herman Servotte Residence located on the Social Sciences campus (Parkstraat 39-53, 3000 Leuven) can be accessed outside of working hours and during holidays with your staff card.
- Parking spots at the **university hospital** (UZ Leuven campus Gasthuisberg) can be refunded in the form of a parking ticket that visitors can use to pay their parking fee. We can buy these tickets (in batches) in advance, so make sure to check beforehand with Klara if we have tickets left or not. New tickets can be ordered by Ying.

## What to do when you leave

We are very sad to see you leave! But since you do, make sure to tick the following boxes:

1. Return the following items to Ying Cai:

	- Any pc material (laptop, mouse, keyboard, etc.)
	- Your external hard drive (and potential USB-key)
	- Your key(card)
	- Your Lync phone

**TODO:** check with Hans if this is correct or where this should go

2.	Make sure your data is organized and backed up correctly. That mostly means having back-ups in different locations and different ways. If you need advice on this, refer to the person in charge of data storage (as of December 2024, that is Klara).
