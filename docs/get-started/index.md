# Welcome to HOPLAB!

We are thrilled to have you join our team at HOPLAB, where we delve into the fascinating world of visual cognition and learning. Our lab is dedicated to exploring how the brain processes and interprets complex visual scenes, integrating insights from neuroscience, psychology, and computational science. As part of our team, you’ll contribute to cutting-edge research that bridges human cognition with artificial intelligence. We look forward to your contributions and to working together on exciting discoveries.

On this onboarding page, you'll find all the information you need to navigate the KU Leuven environment and adapt to our lab’s practices. We’ll guide you in setting up both your physical and digital workspaces, and offer step-by-step instructions for the most common administrative procedures at KU Leuven. Additionally, we’ve curated a selection of resources to give you a strong foundation as you start your journey with us. Dive in, and enjoy your new role!
