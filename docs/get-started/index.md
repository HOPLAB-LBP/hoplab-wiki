# Welcome to HOPLAB

We are thrilled to have you join our team at HOPLAB. Our lab is dedicated to exploring how the brain processes and interprets complex visual scenes, integrating insights from neuroscience, psychology, and computational science. As part of our team, you’ll contribute to cutting-edge research that bridges human cognition with artificial intelligence. We look forward to your contributions and to working together on exciting discoveries.

## Getting started at HOPLAB

On this onboarding page, you'll find all the information you need to navigate the KU Leuven environment and adapt to our lab’s practices. We’ll guide you in setting up both your physical and digital workspaces, and offer step-by-step instructions for the most common administrative procedures at KU Leuven. Additionally, we’ve curated a selection of resources to give you a strong foundation as you start your journey with us.

## Need help?

If you have any questions or run into issues while getting set up, the following resources are available:

- **ICT helpdesk**: For technical issues related to your computer or network access. [ICT FAQ](https://ppw.kuleuven.be/ppw-dict/faq/index.htm)
- **HR advisor**: Find your HR advisor's details in your [KU Loket profile](https://www.kuleuven.be/kuloket).
- **Admin contact**: If you need assistance with (general) lab operations such as equipment and orders, reach out to [Ying Cai](https://www.kuleuven.be/wieiswie/en/person/00098752)
- **PPW Research resources**: Funding info, research support, and infrastructure — see the [PPW Research page](https://ppw.kuleuven.be/en/research).
- **Report technical defects**: Use [KU Loket](https://www.kuleuven.be/kuloket) (HSE & Spaces > Reporting technical defects > New notification) to report building or equipment issues. For lab-specific equipment, contact CLD/technical services directly.

## Health, Safety and Environment

Every new employee (master students, PhDs and postdocs) is welcomed at their workspace and receives a customized introduction and orientation regarding health, safety and environment ([HSE](https://admin.kuleuven.be/sab/vgm/en/doc/hse-organisation/intranet/general-hse-info-brochure-en)). This includes information on first aid, emergency procedures, pregnancy-related guidelines, ergonomics, waste management, psychosocial support, what to do in case of a work accident, how to report issues, and more. It is taken to heart by the unit's HSE Network Coordinator ([Nathalie de Swaef](https://www.kuleuven.be/wieiswie/nl/person/00061461)) or delegated to VGM antenna.

For **people working in the lab**, [Zsuzsanna](https://www.kuleuven.be/wieiswie/nl/person/00048902) will do the HSE orientation in person and register it via SAP. Afterwards, you will need to confirm this via KU Loket. For **people not working in the lab**, you can contact Zsuzsa to go over the HSE checklist with her ( [Dutch](https://kuleuven.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/T0005824-Hoplab/Shared%20Documents/Hoplab/General%20information/HSE/vgm-onthaal_checklist_kantooromgeving_v202402.docx?d=w79bd31b4dfc44dd6aa4241a55ea198aa&csf=1&web=1&e=D0NdvQ) | [English](https://kuleuven.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/T0005824-Hoplab/Shared%20Documents/Hoplab/General%20information/HSE/vgm-onthaal_checklist_kantooromgeving_EN_v202402.docx?d=wb980767944504104b2c90e2038ce32c1&csf=1&web=1&e=aJjkyc) ), or you can do it yourself. In both cases, you and your PI will need to sign a copy and deposit it with [Ying](https://www.kuleuven.be/wieiswie/en/person/00098752).

In the context of the welfare legislation, KU Leuven is required to keep a record of the risks per employee to which they are exposed when performing activities and the preventative measures provided for these risks. This information is registered centrally and digitally in KU Loket in the form of the HSE-file, for both staff and students. If you are new in Hoplab and you haven't been contacted by Zsuzsa, make sure she (and/or Ying) has been informed about your start, including where your office is and what your activities entail.

Finally, at Hoplab, we care deeply about creating a safe and respectful environment for everyone. If you ever experience or witness inappropriate behaviour, or if something doesn’t feel right, know that you are not alone and there is always someone to talk to. KU Leuven offers various support contacts that will listen to you, handle your concerns confidentially, and take further action only if you explicitly request it.
