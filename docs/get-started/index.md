This is the landing page for this section. Please populate it with appropriate information.

**TODO:** populate this landing page.

**TODO:** since this is the most important section for ppl with 0 knowledge on KUL admin and pages, we should probably add more pictures, screenshots and visuals to the children pages of this section. e.g., show where to click, how the page looks like, or any other relevant info.

**TODO** ideas Klara
- Add information on the retreat (maybe add a page on social activities)
- Add info on how to use a computer at Hoplab outside the lab
- Add info on how/where to rent lab coats and how the laundry service works (e.g. for kitchen towels and EEG towels)
- Add info on the remote work policy (of KU Leuven but also of the lab specifically)
- Add info on how to find your phone number
- Add safety and security info, such as emergency numbers and procedures, info on how to report technical defects (KU Loket / HSE & Spaces / Reporting technical defects / New notification), where to find the first aid box, info on who the lab's first aid and EIP responsible is, info on shredding paper with sensitive information,...
- Add PhD related info (milestones?)
- Add page on how to deal with stress at work/psychosocial support in the lab or at KU Leuven
- Make a list of office spaces and who can be found where
