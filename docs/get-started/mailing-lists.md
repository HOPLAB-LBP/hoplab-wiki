# Some useful mailing lists

If you just got started in the lab, you might want to make sure you're added on all of the relevant mailing lists that we often use or refer to.

### The essentials

Here are the mailing lists you _need_ to be subscribed to.

- The **LBP mailing list** (*PSYLBP@LS.KULEUVEN.BE*). The most important mailing list administratively. Any first-hand administrative communication will go through there, including building-, retreat-, and kitchen-related information. You will need to find the LBP technician and ask to be registered. Use this email when you need to communicate something at the LBP level.
- The **HopLab group email** (*hop_lab@googlegroups.com*). Many important communications are made lab-wise through it. Most importantly, lab meeting details are sent through there, alongside all of the communication that cannot be made via chat. Use this email to send something to the lab that is not more easily shared on our chat platform (Slack), or to forward important emails.

### The recommended

- The **LBI newsletter** (register through [this website](https://www.kuleuven.be/brain-institute/join-lbi/newsflash/form)) communicates any event the LBI organises. This is mostly important to stay updated on things like the annual LBI scientific meeting, but also extra science communication events.
- The **BAPS newsletter** (register on [their main page](https://www.baps.be/)) can be of relevance for Belgium-wise psychological science events & news. For instance, the yearly BAPS meeting will be shared through this channel.
- The **MRI mailing list** (*MRI@LS.KULEUVEN.BE*) will report any news concerning the MR8 scanner at the hospital. If you scan or plan on scanning, this is a must. It will tell you if the scanner breaks down, if there are any new guidelines to follow, or more commonly, if any booked timeslot is cancelled. This is a KULeuven-based mailing list, which you can register to [on this website](http://ls.kuleuven.be/).
  
### The optional

- The **visionlist** is the main community-wide newsletter for vision sciences. Any opening position, conference, summer school you might be interest in will be on there (more info [here](https://visionscience.com/mailman/listinfo/visionlist_visionscience.com)).
- The **CVnet mailing list** communicates about everything colour and vision-related. Conferences, positions, community news will be posted on there (more info [here](http://lawton.ewind.com/mailman/listinfo/cvnet)).
- If you're a PhD, the **Doctoral school mailing** (*ppw.doctoraten@kuleuven.be*) list can be useful to you. You can find it on the [KULeuven mailing list server]((http://ls.kuleuven.be/)).
