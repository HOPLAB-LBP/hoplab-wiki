# Do great science and present it somewhere

(We'll start small and go bigger)

## Lab meetings

**TODO:** Add information, guidelines and refer to previous presentations on Teams/OneDrive

## Conference posters

### Making a Conference Poster
Below you can find some instructions for making a conference poster:

- For general guidelines on how to make a poster, check out [this page](https://admin.kuleuven.be/icts/english/research/dissemination/sciposter/acadposter).
- For practical information about poster printing at the university, check out [this page](https://icts.kuleuven.be/sc/english/education/plotter) and/or [this page](https://admin.kuleuven.be/icts/english/services/plotter/plotter).

#### Poster Printing Request
When you need to print your poster, make a "Large-format printing request" by filling in [the form](https://www.groupware.kuleuven.be/sites/lio2/gebruikerslab/Paginas/FormulierPosters.aspx): 

1. Choose your paper type:
	- "140gr" is the most normal paper
	- "Glanzend" is a shiny version of it
	- "Canvas" is foldable, thick canvas and therefore useful for travelling
2. Choose your paper size and the number of copies
3. Upload your file (in .pdf)
4. Choose whether you need a poster tube and whether you want them to trim the white borders of your poster
5. Choose where you want to pick up your poster
6. Make sure to ask for an invoice and use the u-number of An Van Kets to finalize your request (u0057838)

## Present your work (and announce it)

You can find KU Leuven PowerPoint and LaTeX templates for presentations [here](https://admin.kuleuven.be/mykuleuven/en/theme/ict-communication-events/communication-guidelines-tools/layout-and-printed-materials/templates-for-presentations). Please consult [this page](https://admin.kuleuven.be/icts/opleidingen/englishwebsite/powerpoint-templates#install) to correctly use the official KU Leuven brand templates.

### Announcing a Presentation
It is good practice to announce a presentation you organise at PPW and get it published in the PPW faculty calendar. Usually, we coordinate such announcements at the B&C level, which means that Kirsten Blommaerts handles the reservations and announcements. If she is not available, you can do it yourself using the instructions below (or ask Klara if needed):

1. Browse to the calendar of the PPW faculty, which you can find [here](https://ppw.kuleuven.be/agenda/eng)
2. Make sure you are logged in on the website with your KU Leuven credentials
3. Click on "Add new items (Dutch)"
4. Click on the year the presentation will take place in (this year or next year)
5. Click on "+ Nieuw" > "Agenda-item" 
6. Add information in the relevant text boxes (at least the title, abstract, time, and location of your presentation)
7. Save your changes

After a limited moderation period by PPW's communication department, your announcement will appear online. If you experience issues adding the item to the calendar, please check out [the manual](https://ppw.kuleuven.be/agenda/handleiding-agenda-20200204.pdf).

### Example Announcements
Below you can find an example announcement for a general seminar:

## SciComm trainings and opportunities

### Reasons to Start Engaging in SciComm
If you are already interested in science communication, that's great! If you need some more convincing, here are some good **reasons to start engaging**:

- It allows you to connect with other researchers and stakeholders, which can boost your motivation and lead to new collaborations.
- It helps you to develop skills relevant to your future career, such as public speaking, explaining complex concepts, writing and networking. 
- Funders (like the KU Leuven, FWO and ERC) value SciComm efforts.
- You are funded by society, so it's crucial for the public to know about your research.
- Despite the fact that it can be stressful, it is also enjoyable and very rewarding!

### Straightforward Ideas for SciComm Participation
The easiest and **most straightforward ideas** to start participating in SciComm yourself are: 

- By being active on social media (e.g., on X)
- By creating video abstracts for your paper and starting a Youtube channel
- By writing a press release if you have done newsworthy research (ask the [KU Leuven press office](https://nieuws.kuleuven.be/en/press-office/press-office-and-policy-communications) for help) 
- By writing and publishing a blog post about your research (e.g., on [EOS blogs](https://www.eoswetenschap.eu/eosblogs), see for example [Klara's blog](https://www.eoswetenschap.eu/psyche-brein/wat-als-je-je-taal-verliest-na-een-beroerte))
- By making a podcast about your research

### Training and Opportunities
Check out the following sources if you want to **train yourself**:

- Visuals and slide design: [Principiae](https://www.principiae.be/X0101.php). Jean-Luc Doumont is a great speaker and frequently gives workshops at KU Leuven on how to create effective slides, posters, presentations, etc.
- Pitching, writing and presenting: [The Floor is Yours](https://thefloorisyours.be/en/). They offer workshops and coaching on how to tell your story in a clear and convincing manner, can help you bring your research in the media or make policy impact.
- Crash course on SciComm: [Let's Talk Science summer school](https://www.letstalkscience.be/). A must-do three-day event all about communicative competences.
- Infographics: [Baryon](https://baryon.be/). Company of Koen Van den Eeckhout (PhD in physics), who provides workshops on how to visually present complex data.
- All things SciComm: [SciMingo](https://www.scimingo.eu/en). One of the driving forces of SciComm in Flanders. They are the driving force behind many initiatives, such as Science Figured Out, the Flemish PhD Cup and the Scicomm Academy (see below). They also offer lots of workshops (e.g., for podcasting).
- SciComm in the form of theater: [ERLNMYR](https://www.erlnmyr.be/en/home). Company of Ben Verhoeven (PhD in computational linguistics), who uses methods from improvisational theater to improve science communication.
- Science videos: [Amazink](https://amazink.nl/). Company of Rob Zink (PhD in biomedical signal processing), who offers a variety of freelance visualization services.

### Engaging Initiatives
If you can't wait to start engaging, check out the following **initiatives**:

- [Science Figured Out](https://www.sciencefiguredout.be/) (SciMingo) is a project in which you are coached to record a 3-minute pitch about your research. A professionally edited video is afterwards published on several social media channels. For example, check out Klara's video [here](http://www.sciencefiguredout.be/language-recovery-after-stroke).
- [Dag van De Wetenschap](https://www.dagvandewetenschap.be/) is the biggest yearly science event in Flanders, to which you can participate with your research group and organize something fun!
- [Kinderuniversiteit](https://www.kuleuven.be/kinderuniversiteit/) organizes yearly workshops for children to get acquainted with research.
- [Science is Wonderful!](https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/science-is-wonderful) gives primary and secondary school students the change to interact with EU-funded researchers in an engaging format.
- [Falling Walls Lab](https://www.kuleuven.be/communicatie/wetenschapscommunicatie/voor-onderzoekers/falling-walls-lab/falling-walls-lab-for-candidates) is an international pitching competition for researchers (with coaching). The winner goes to Berlin!
- [The Flemish PhD Cup](https://www.phdcup.be/) is a competition for freshly promoted PhD'ers, including media training at VRT NWS. The winner gets a lot of media attention, can give a video lecture at the [Universiteit van Vlaanderen](https://www.universiteitvanvlaanderen.be/) and can publish a book.
- [The Battle of the Scientists](https://wetenschapsbattle.be/voor-wetenschappers/?lang=eng) is a competition where you explain your research to children in schools.
- [Nerdland Festival](https://www.nerdlandfestival.be/nl/) is the biggest science festival in Flanders hosted by Lieven Scheire, to which you can participate with cool ideas.
