# Do great science and show it to the world

(We'll start small and go bigger)

## Lab meetings

### lab meetings schedule
Lab meetings usually happen once per week on Mondays, after lunch. On that day, we have lunch together in the meeting room and then move to the more science-y affairs. 
The meeting room will be specified in a reminder email that is sent every Thursday before the lab meeting and can be seen in the meeting schedule.
The schedule is made at the beginning of the academic year and consists of a mix of meetings with updates and others with more fixed topics.

### Attendance
You can attend the meetings in person or online, there will be always a link to a Teams call. If you will be online, or absent, let the lab meeting manager know. 

### Who is presenting
Each lab member is part of the standard rotation of presenters for the individual meetings. Additionally, they are assigned to one of the batches that will alternate in the quick updates. Interns are usually not part of the standard roations, but will be assigned to a batch. 

The rotation of presenters is made by randomizing the order of the names, but can be adjusted based on anyone's availability. If you want / need to switch your slot, you can directly contact the person you would like to switch with and then let the lab meeting manager know about the change. If you would like to change with a slot assigned for a group meeting, ask the lab meeting manager directly.  

### Types of lab meetings
There are different types of lab meetings that happen throughout the academic year.

- Individual meetings: on a rotation basis, each lab member is assigned with a slot and is in charge of the presentation. On this occasion, you can present an update on your research, an interesting / relevant paper for a Journal Club (JC), or other important topics (practicing an upcoming talk or interview, for example). 
- Quick updates: once per month, lab memebers assigned to a specific batch will give a quick (1-2 slides, 15 minutes) update on the latest development in their work. This meeting is an occasion to ask for help if you are stuck on a particular step, method, analysis, or to just keep each other in the loop. If your individual meeting is scheduled for the week before or the week after your batch, you can skip the quick update for the longer one. 
- Conference updates: after someone has been on a conference, this type of meeting is scheduled when someone goes on a conference. The idea is for that person (or those people) to give an overview of the conference and present studies of interest for the lab. This type of meeting does not have a regular frequency.
- New papers: once every two months, we meet to discuss new papers that came out recently. This is an occasion to discuss new topics, new methods, or just interesting work that you might have seen around. There is no fixed presenter, we will go over the list of papers one by one and the person who added it will introduce it. At any time, if you see an intersting paper you can add it to the [reading list](https://kuleuven.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/T0005824-Hoplab/_layouts/15/Doc2.aspx?action=edit&sourcedoc=%7Bb985e56f-b02f-437c-a511-05a10d8dfe68%7D&wdOrigin=TEAMS-MAGLEV.teamsSdk_ns.rwc&wdExp=TEAMS-TREATMENT&wdhostclicktime=1724147078370&web=1)

### Presentations
To keep the folders in order, there are some guidelines on how to store the lab meetings presentations. 

- Make sure the name of the presentation follows the naming conventions ('YYYY-MM-DD_presenter_topic').
- Before presenting them, put your slides for a quick update in 'Hoplab > Science outreach > Lab meetings > 1-slide updates'. This will make possible presenting all the updates from one computer.
- After the lab meeting, store your presentation in 'Hoplab > Science outreach > Lab meetings > Past LM presentations'.
- In case of a Journal Club, add the paper of interest to 'Hoplab > Science outreach > Lab meetings > Papers' so that lab members can check it before the lab meeting.

#### Poster Printing Request
When you need to print your poster, make a "Large-format printing request" by filling in [the form](https://www.groupware.kuleuven.be/sites/lio2/gebruikerslab/Paginas/FormulierPosters.aspx): 

1. Choose your paper type:
	- "140gr" is the most normal paper
	- "Glanzend" is a shiny version of it
	- "Canvas" is foldable, thick canvas and therefore useful for travelling
2. Choose your paper size and the number of copies
3. Upload your file (in .pdf)
4. Choose whether you need a poster tube and whether you want them to trim the white borders of your poster
5. Choose where you want to pick up your poster
6. Make sure to ask for an invoice and use the u-number of An Van Kets to finalize your request (u0057838)

## Present your work (and announce it)

You can find KU Leuven PowerPoint and LaTeX templates for presentations [here](https://admin.kuleuven.be/mykuleuven/en/theme/ict-communication-events/communication-guidelines-tools/layout-and-printed-materials/templates-for-presentations). Please consult [this page](https://admin.kuleuven.be/icts/opleidingen/englishwebsite/powerpoint-templates#install) to correctly use the official KU Leuven brand templates.

### Announcing a presentation
It is good practice to announce a presentation you organise at PPW and get it published in the PPW faculty calendar. Usually, we coordinate such announcements at the B&C level, which means that Kirsten Blommaerts handles the reservations and announcements. If she is not available, you can do it yourself using the instructions below (or ask Klara if needed):

1. Browse to the calendar of the PPW faculty, which you can find [here](https://ppw.kuleuven.be/agenda/eng)
2. Make sure you are logged in on the website with your KU Leuven credentials
3. Click on "Add new items (Dutch)"
4. Click on the year the presentation will take place in (this year or next year)
5. Click on "+ Nieuw" > "Agenda-item" 
6. Add information in the relevant text boxes (at least the title, abstract, time, and location of your presentation)
7. Save your changes

After a limited moderation period by PPW's communication department, your announcement will appear online. If you experience issues adding the item to the calendar, please check out [the manual](https://ppw.kuleuven.be/agenda/handleiding-agenda-20200204.pdf).

### Example announcements

## Science communication (SciComm)

### Reasons to start engaging in SciComm
If you are already interested in science communication, that's great! If you need some more convincing, here are some good **reasons to start engaging**:

- It allows you to connect with other researchers and stakeholders, which can boost your motivation and lead to new collaborations.
- It helps you to develop skills relevant to your future career, such as public speaking, explaining complex concepts, writing and networking. 
- Funders (like the KU Leuven, FWO and ERC) value SciComm efforts.
- You are funded by society, so it's crucial for the public to know about your research.
- Despite the fact that it can be stressful, it is also enjoyable and very rewarding!

### Straightforward ideas for SciComm participation
The easiest and **most straightforward ideas** to start participating in SciComm yourself are: 

- Being active on social media (e.g., on X)
- Creating video abstracts for your paper and starting a Youtube channel
- Writing a press release if you have done newsworthy research (ask the [KU Leuven press office](https://nieuws.kuleuven.be/en/press-office/press-office-and-policy-communications) for help) 
- Writing and publishing a blog post about your research (e.g., on [EOS blogs](https://www.eoswetenschap.eu/eosblogs), see for example [Klara's blog](https://www.eoswetenschap.eu/psyche-brein/wat-als-je-je-taal-verliest-na-een-beroerte))
- Making a podcast about your research

### Training and opportunities
Check out the following sources if you want to **train yourself**:

- Visuals and slide design: [Principiae](https://www.principiae.be/X0101.php). Jean-Luc Doumont is a great speaker and frequently gives workshops at KU Leuven on how to create effective slides, posters, presentations, etc.
- Pitching, writing and presenting: [The Floor is Yours](https://thefloorisyours.be/en/). They offer workshops and coaching on how to tell your story in a clear and convincing manner, can help you bring your research in the media or make policy impact.
- Crash course on SciComm: [Let's Talk Science summer school](https://www.letstalkscience.be/). A must-do three-day event all about communicative competences.

**TODO**: [Klara] Add info on the lab's social media, if that exists, and who manages it
**TODO**: [Klara] Add info on where to find certain lab templates/logos (if they exist) e.g. for posters, presentations
