# Hoplab Wiki

Welcome to the Hoplab Wiki repository. This Wiki is a work in progress and an ongoing effort to migrate all the Hoplab knowledge and procedures into a more user-friendly format. This process is currently managed by [@costantinoai](https://github.com/costantinoai) and [@kschevenels](https://github.com/kschevenels). For any questions, feel free to [ping me](mailto:andreaivan.costantino@kuleuven.be).

**TODO:** populate this homepage with more info about the sections. Who lands here should know where to go at a glance. Important: in smaller screens (e.g. mobile) the nav bar is **not** visible immediately. This would make more complicated for ppl to know where to go and what the wiki offer --> improve info in the home page
